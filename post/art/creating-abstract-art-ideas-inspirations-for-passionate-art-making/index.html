<p>Gary Hallgren</p>
<p>Ink on paper</p>
<p>Like the word <em>art</em> itself, abstract art cannot be clearly defined or categorized. I choose to go with the flow, make work and celebrate abstract art for its nonconformist place in the world of art. In other words, doing beats thinking about doing in this book. With certainty more artists than ever choose to work abstractly, as they see an endless supply of ideas and uncharted territory yet to explore.</p>
<p>I believe the continuing interest in abstract art lies in its ability to inspire our curiosity about the reaches of an artist&#8217;s creative subconscious.</p>
<p>My goal is to show you numerous pathways to looking at, thinking about and, most importantly, <em>creating</em> abstract art. To achieve that, you&#8217;ll use the most valuable asset for making evocative and meaningful abstract artwork: your innate curiosity.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a focus here on the power of abstract art to delve into the surreal realms of imagery swimming around in our heads. I want to help you find your own unique identity as an abstract artist by addressing the obstacles that limit your creativity.</p>
<p>I aim to inspire you to move beyond the myths and stereotypes that abound for abstract art in order to discover the myriad of possibilities for making inventive and original pictures without inhibition or fear of failure, all the while enjoying the creative process itself!</p>
<p>To that end, I will not give you step-by-step instructions on making a particular style of abstract painting or sculpture, nor will I give you a recipe for how to make something look abstract.</p>
<p>I want my experience from a forty-year career as an artist and art educator and nearly two hundred exhibitions of my abstract work in the United States and abroad to motivate and encourage you to get completely absorbed in creating abstract art yourself.</p>
<p>This book is organized much like my first publication, <em>Art From Intuition</em>, in that we&#8217;ll be working with a base project description and series of exercises that start you out on a path, yet let you explore different directions to take. In other words, I&#8217;ll give you an idea as a starting point and encourage you to follow your own instincts to see what evolves from there.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the artworks shown in this book illustrate very different outcomes from the individuals who began with the same set of guidelines. You&#8217;ll find several excellent projects in this book that were first introduced in <em>Art From Intuition</em> but that have been expanded to focus on making abstract art.</p>
<p>You can think of this book as a kind of scavenger hunt where you find clues that direct you to something that excites your imagination. For those of you who are flea market fans like me, think about the fun you have finding something exceptional hidden among the ordinary cast-offs. Finding treasures in uncharted territory is the instinct I&#8217;m hoping to bring out in you.</p>
<p>In essence, I want this book to be fun to read and easy to use without exhausting your attention span or your wallet. I&#8217;ll keep the emphasis on <em>making</em> instead of <em>thinking about making.</em> In addition, most of the projects in this book can be created using low-tech, inexpensive materials.</p>
<p>Some basics to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>This book is not set up to read or work from in chronological order. You can choose any chapter or project that perks up your interest and begin making something without worrying that you&#8217;ve skipped ahead and missed something you should know first.</li>
<li>The projects in the book should be approached as if you were sketching out an idea in a spontaneous way rather than putting the finishing touches on a painting. In other words, I want you to look for possibilities that you can develop further.</li>
<li>Each project is accompanied by sample works made by students and practicing artists showing what each did with the same set of instructions. <em>Again, these do not show what your piece should look like; rather, each one represents an individual&#8217;s creative idea inspired by that particular project.</em></li>
<li>Consider building specific categories of work that you may keep in separate folders or portfolios as you do the projects in the book. I recommend you have these for sketch projects you want to take further such as TBC (To Be Continued), where the sketch you made suggests a bigger scale, using different materials or simply a new idea that you want to pursue from this inspiration.<br>Your TBC portfolio can also provide you with useful parts that can be combined or collaged into new works.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other portfolio I&#8217;d keep is for those pieces you think you hate and you&#8217;d just as soon tear up. The irony of the so-called &#8220;Hate It!&#8221; art you make is that you may change your mind once something is tucked away for a few weeks, plus there may be some treasures in this &#8220;trash&#8221; that you didn&#8217;t see the first time around.</p>
<p>In addition, any pieces you feel came out great or finished as they are can go in a separate portfolio or be put on display as you choose.</p>
<ul>
<li>The materials I recommend using in this book are generally inexpensive and easy to come by, since I don&#8217;t want you to dwell on the cost or preciousness of what you&#8217;re making. You always have the option of substituting any materials of your choice for those I&#8217;m recommending.</li>
<li>Some of the projects in this book may seem to overlap or use the same ingredients to reach different conclusions. For example, a project in the basic elements section of chapter one that focuses on line may also have a similar series of steps that conclude with a focus on texture. There are important distinctions between line as the main character in one project and an emphasis on texture in another.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve included the works and artist statements by fifty artists in this publication so you can consider the wide variety of ideas and approaches being practiced by abstract artists today. I hope you find their work and ideas to be an inspiration to delve into abstract art yourself.</li>
<li>The projects offered in this book will not tell you the correct order of stages in a process to achieve a desired result. To the contrary, I want to get your creative juices flowing and see where your imagination takes you, and the desired result is one that can&#8217;t be precisely pictured or described. In other words, you won&#8217;t hear me say or imply that any composition you come up with &#8220;should&#8221; necessarily look anything like an artwork pictured in this book. And using this book to inspire your art-making simply works better if you embrace the fact that every project leads to choices and options that have any number of positive results.</li>
<li>Since you know you can&#8217;t control the likes and dislikes of anyone else, it&#8217;s important to focus on what works for you and tune out the noise in your head about the possible popularity of what you make.<br>I know that this more open-ended process can be somewhat frustrating, making you feel a bit adrift, not knowing exactly where you&#8217;re going, but the need to take pleasure in exploring uncharted territory is an essential part of the nature of abstraction that you can either embrace with enthusiasm for the challenges it poses to your imagination or choose to constantly fight with that part of yourself that insists on predictability and order. If that stuffy, opinionated part of yourself keeps winning out, you&#8217;ll get less out of reading and practicing what&#8217;s in this book than you might have if you just let go!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be confident that whatever direction you pursue using the projects and ideas in this book, you&#8217;ll have fun, and whatever your resulting picture or artwork looks like, your pieces will be a unique personal expression from your own creative subconscious. And though you&#8217;ll make some pieces you like and others you won&#8217;t like, the only thing you can do wrong in art is not make art.</p>

<p>Wassily Kandinsky (1866&#8211;1944) is the first man who, with paint and brush, created a nonrepresentational work of art. In his memoirs, Kandinsky described the actual moment of the accidental discovery of nonrepresentational or abstract art when he was forty-four years old. Coming home at sunset from an outdoor session 1910, his mind still absorbed by his work, he was struck as he entered his studio by an &#8220;indescribably beautiful painting, all irradiated by an interior light.&#8221; In the mysterious canvas he could distinguish only &#8220;forms and colors and no meaning.&#8221; Suddenly he realized that it was one of his own paintings, turned on its side. &#8220;The next day I tried to recapture my previous impression. I only succeeded half way. Even with the painting on its side, I could always find the object, but the blue light of dusk was missing. I knew then precisely that objects were harming my painting.&#8221; He felt &#8220;a terrifying abyss opening under my feet.&#8221; Suddenly one man, Kandinsky, stood up and, instead of facing outward from himself, turned and looked into himself.</p>

<h1 id="CHAPTER-ONE"><a href="#CHAPTER-ONE" class="headerlink" title="CHAPTER ONE"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 id="Get-Started-and-Keep-Going"><a href="#Get-Started-and-Keep-Going" class="headerlink" title="Get Started and Keep Going!"></a>Get Started and Keep Going!</h1><p>A major obstacle to making abstract art is the barrier in your mind that questions whether abstract art is a legitimate art form, legitimate for you at least.</p>
<p>This block may be because you still wonder whether abstract art is really art at all. Possibly you think you have to master realism before you can work abstractly. It could be that you worry your friends and family won&#8217;t approve. Or maybe it&#8217;s simply that you don&#8217;t know how to begin making an abstract composition.</p>
<p>The quick answers to these issues are as follows:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Historically, abstract art is a legitimate art form; that judgment was settled over a century ago.</li>
<li>No, you don&#8217;t have to earn a diploma in realism before you make abstract art, and no one checks your artistic credentials at the door.</li>
<li>If you routinely did everything that your friends and family approved of, you would not have picked up this book in the first place. Artists of whatever stripe are rebels against the grain of society no matter what they choose to do, and you should think of making abstract art as an outsider&#8217;s merit badge that sets you apart from the crowd.</li>
<li>Worrying about any of the above factors can stop you before you begin, and frankly the only relevant question is &#8220;How do I start making an abstract composition right now?&#8221;<br><em>Where art comes from is a mystery. It comes unannounced. It has the quality of gift. The source from where it comes is hidden from us. Like all creativity, it stands us in possibility. It comes from impulse and dream, from raiding the inarticulate, from going below the floor of consciousness. To do this we must break free of the confines of the known and fixed. As artists we do this with our materials&#8212;with our hands. And in this confluence of mind and matter abstraction is not only relevant, it is essential.</em> &#8212;Timothy Hawkesworth</li>

<p>One of the hardest things to do in art&#8212;and maybe harder in abstract art&#8212;is to start making something on a pure white, blank page.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs86rmiav5j20go0fkgng.jpg" alt=""> The blank canvas</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re confronting an empty canvas or a clean piece of paper or sitting there with a big lump of clay in your hands, trying to think about what to make can stop you dead in your tracks. And though I cannot suggest a wonder drug that will put you in the right frame of mind, this chapter&#8217;s goal is to get you started making something before your subconscious mind has a chance to say anything to stop you!</p>
<p>This first set of projects gives you some quick-start exercises that get you going. I recommend you think of these projects as warm-up exercises in the same way that musicians tune their instruments, dancers stretch and move to loosen up or writers put down a stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>The second group of projects uses the basic elements of art&#8212;line, shape, form, value, texture and color&#8212;as starting places from which to expand. These fundamental ingredients, found in some measure in all works of art, are logical places to initiate abstract compositions.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, some of the projects in this and other chapters originated in my first book, <em>Art From Intuition</em>, but they are worth repeating because they are extremely effective tools for shifting your art engine from <em>park</em> into <em>drive</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Icebreakers-and-Warm-Ups"><a href="#Icebreakers-and-Warm-Ups" class="headerlink" title="Icebreakers and Warm-Ups"></a>Icebreakers and Warm-Ups</h2><p>The projects in this section allow you to get going on something without thinking or worrying about what you&#8217;re making. Keep in mind that these projects are designed to be fun to do, so don&#8217;t be self-conscious about &#8220;making art&#8221;&#8212;just enjoy the freedom of playing in the sand again!</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs86pztbtoj20go0bpgnj.jpg" alt=""> Start with eleven dots</p>
<h2 id="EXERCISE-1-Connecting-Eleven-Dots"><a href="#EXERCISE-1-Connecting-Eleven-Dots" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 1: Connecting Eleven Dots"></a>EXERCISE 1: Connecting Eleven Dots</h2><p>This project suggests that you begin your drawing or painting by placing eleven small dots, at random, on a piece of paper and start connecting those dots with lines. Think of the dots as hubs or anchors for the lines to connect to in a variety of ways. You could approach this project as a kind of game to see what different compositions evolve as you explore variations that come with the placement of the dots on the page, their proximity to one another and how your composition develops using different techniques and mediums.</p>
<p>Remember the only rule here is to simply connect eleven dots with lines. Questions may come up such as &#8220;How many lines do I make?&#8221; &#8220;Are these straight lines, curved lines, broken lines?&#8221; These can be answered in so many ways, and the pleasure of this line game is discovering new solutions each time you work on this project.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recommend thinking about many of your choices before you start working. This project, like many others in this book, works best when you approach the challenge spontaneously.</p>
<p>Because there are so many possible directions to go with this project, I want to keep things simple at first, so I recommend you use only one color or black and white for the first eleven dot project and save color and collage variations for separate projects. Of course, you can always skip ahead to color or collage variations if you choose. As with all projects in this book, you start with an initial set of guidelines and then you take it anywhere you want from there.</p>

Think of the original lines you make as part of a skeleton or superstructure that you&#8217;ll use to build your composition. There are limitless possibilities for compositions that begin with just eleven dots!</p>

A key aspect is that you must keep focused on moving forward rather than try to control what is taking shape in front of you. This is kind of a natural metamorphosis in abstract art since there&#8217;s always the prospect for the shapes, lines and textures to evolve into new structures as you draw or paint.</p>
<p>Begin your automatic drawing by making a mark on a piece of paper with any kind of black-and-white or color medium and just go wherever that takes you. No need to predetermine what kind of mark should come first or how to proceed from there, nor is there any model for what the resulting drawing should look like.</p>
<p>You simply have to trust the process, keep making more lines and shapes and repeating actions as your composition starts taking form. If you haven&#8217;t done this kind of spontaneous drawing before, think of this process like you did the first time you tried to ride a bike without training wheels&#8212;get on, start pedaling, build momentum and ride!</p>

<p>This project asks you to revisit those basic creative passions that were so strong in your childhood by sticking your fingers in paint and playing for the pure pleasure of the process. If you can suspend your inhibitions about acting like a kid for a few hours, this project will help you find the roots of your creative intuition and inspire a renewed sense of excitement and adventure in your art making.</p>
<p>Action painting is nothing more than letting the paint do what it wants to do with a little help from you. The first thing to try might be the loosest form of action painting, where you begin by soaking a brush with paint and dripping and splashing paint onto your paper or canvas. Let the paint spatter and drip as you make bold, impromptu gestures, or change to more subtle patterns of movement to see what kinds of marks those gestures create.</p>
<p>Try using brushes of different sizes and paints of different colors, and let your marks merge together on the canvas.</p>
<p>The first few times you try action painting should be purely experimental. The important thing to remember is that unpredictability is what you are after, so you can revel in the pure enjoyment of playing with the paint. Begin to experiment with different approaches: Try flinging paint off the brush to create explosive spatters, dripping paint from different heights or pouring paint of different thicknesses (diluted with various amounts of water) onto the canvas at the same time.</p>

<p>Janet Stupak</p>
<p>One of the unique things about action painting is that the resulting pictures are a visual record of the artist&#8217;s &#8220;dance&#8221; that created the painting in the first place.</p>
<p>Action painting emphasizes the dynamics of the painting process with a focus on movement, gesture and free-form play. This approach is a good place to start using your intuition because it allows you to use materials freely and to explore spontaneity and dynamic change without exerting overt control over the painting process. Action painting can involve your whole body, not just your hands, and allow you to use new tools and movements to make a work of art.</p>

Though there is not universal agreement on fitting names for these fundamental ingredients, the six most common terms used by artists and art historians are <em>line, shape, form, texture, value</em> and <em>color.</em></p>
<p>Each of these six elements is distinct from one another in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line:</strong> An artist&#8217;s tool used to illustrate the outer edges of shapes and forms. Technically, no physical lines exist in nature. For example, there is not an actual line around an apple to distinguish it from the table it&#8217;s sitting on, nor is there a physical line between the sky and the land at the horizon; therefore, lines in art are an artist&#8217;s interpretation of the boundaries between forms in a scene, or the perceived edges of shapes in a composition. Repeated lines can also be used to create values and textures in two-dimensional and three-dimensional art.</li>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> The outside two-dimensional contour, outline or border of a form, figure or structure.</li>
<li><strong>Form:</strong> The three-dimensional representation of a shape. In drawings, paintings and other two-dimensional art, the artist creates the illusion of a three-dimensional form in space using light, shadow and other rendering techniques. In sculpture, the form is the manifestation of the object itself.</li>
<li><strong>Texture:</strong> The distinctive surface qualities found on all things as well as the overall visual patterns and tactile feel of objects and their surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> The relative lightness or darkness of shapes, forms and backgrounds of two-dimensional or three-dimensional compositions. Value plays a prominent role in both black-and-white and color artworks, potentially adding dramatic contrasts and depth to an otherwise bland composition.</li>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> The spectrum of hues, values and intensities of natural light and man-made pigments, paints and mineral compounds that can be used in all art forms.<br>The challenge in the following projects is to focus on each individual element as the main player in an abstract composition in order to exploit its potential and inspire new direction in your work. I&#8217;m providing at least one project that emphasizes each basic element in this section, but I&#8217;m sure you could easily come up with many variations and projects yourself. All of these projects also fit the quick-start theme in this chapter, so read the basic idea, gather your materials and get going!</li>

<h3 id="LINE"><a href="#LINE" class="headerlink" title="LINE"></a>LINE</h3><p>Even though line is an artistic invention that is not part of the natural world, it may be the most used element found in artistic compositions of all kinds. And whether line is used to rough out preliminary sketches or as the key part of a finished artwork, it&#8217;s the workhorse of the basic elements.</p>
<p>The following exercises ask you to consider the variables of line qualities such as thick and thin, sharp or smooth, passive or aggressive and so on, as the vocabulary for your compositions emphasizing line. Think of line as if it were the superstructure of a house you are building, where the integrity of the final project is dependent on the strategy for using the line.</p>

Tape may be an unlikely art material, but you&#8217;ll find lots of possibilities here. The basic process is to make linear compositions with the tape by changing the variables of tape width, length, texture and color. Though each composition you make will be different, you don&#8217;t necessarily have to use all the variables in each composition. You can also combine tape with charcoal, paint, ink and other media to expand on the possibilities. There are no rules or limits to what you can do with tape, and your compositions can expand in many directions.</p>

The nice thing about using a chalk line is that you can ignore the practical functions it was designed for and focus on the aesthetic qualities intrinsic to the material itself.</p>
<p>Chalk-line tools are designed to make straight lines on a flat surface by pulling the line taut with a partner, holding it against the paper and snapping the line. You can approach this as a spontaneous drawing, making lines at random until you see a composition forming, or work out a schematic idea about where the line should go. Connecting eleven random dots with chalk lines may be an easy entry into this project. You may want to use chalk as a beginning stage and add paint or other materials later.</p>
<p>Chalk comes in a few standard colors&#8212;red, blue, yellow and green&#8212;but you can substitute raw powdered pigments in any color to replace commercial chalk and get more color variety in your composition. To draw using a chalk line I recommend working on large paper or canvas&#8212;30” &#215; 40” (76cm &#215; 102cm) or greater&#8212;for the best effect. The most economical paper for large-scale drawings like this is butcher paper, in white or brown, that comes in 24” to 72” &#215; 50’ to 100’ rolls (61cm to 183cm &#215; 15m to 30m). Black tar paper and red construction paper also work well as does plain giftwrap paper that comes in wide widths and long lengths.</p>

<h3 id="SHAPE"><a href="#SHAPE" class="headerlink" title="SHAPE"></a>SHAPE</h3><p>Like finding a wonderfully formed stone or unusual seashell on the beach, it&#8217;s often the shape of something that catches our eye. In the studio, artists may choose to emphasize a shape as the main element in a composition because of the same allure that attracts us to objects in nature.</p>
<p>The following projects are focused on shape as the subject, and they challenge you to invent compositions that celebrate shape over other features in your art.</p>

This may seem like a simple task, but there are many subtle nuances in play beyond just making something look big. The trick is to present a shape (or shapes) that attracts the eye without being overwhelmed by other competing elements such as line, texture and color. The point here is not to win the Best Shape Alone Award as that has no benefit in your art making. Rather, take this up as a challenge to bring a focal point to your composition, and leave the viewers fascinated by what they see!</p>
<p>The instructions then for this project are simple: Make a big shape on your paper and develop it as you go. Use your instincts to decide what looks right and then leave it alone! Decisions about the type of shape and its color and texture are limitless.</p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-9-Shadow-Hunting"><a href="#EXERCISE-9-Shadow-Hunting" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 9: Shadow Hunting"></a>EXERCISE 9: Shadow Hunting</h2><p>Though shadows are all around us, they are often ignored for their potential as subject matter in art. Shadows are a rich resource to find intriguing shapes in our environment.</p>
<p>This project requires searching for a variety of shadows that can be indoors behind bright lights or outside on a sunny day. The mission of the shadow hunt is to sketch as many different kinds of shadow shapes as possible without necessarily thinking about how they will be used in your work.</p>
<p>First, find interesting shadows outdoors, and sketch their outlines on separate pieces of paper. You can also combine two or more shadows on a single sheet of paper to make more complex shape configurations. Try to gather at least a dozen shadow sketches on separate sheets of paper, at least 18” &#215; 24” (46cm &#215; 61cm). Consider making your sketches at a time of day when sunlight is most intense overhead or when the sun casts long, exaggerated shadows as it nears the horizon.</p>
<p>The shadow-drawing project is also well suited for working with a partner. In this variation, each partner takes a turn drawing the shadow outlines and, alternately, posing to create the shadows for his partner. &#8220;Move this way,&#8221; &#8220;Bend your arm a little more,&#8221; &#8220;Reach out at more of an angle&#8221; and so on&#8212;until he sees a shadow to trace. Each partner takes a turn posing for shadows and tracing shadow outlines until they both have about twenty separate shadow sketches.</p>
<p>Once you have your stock of shadows, you can begin working into these sketches as you did in the last project using any mediums of your choice.</p>
<p>Choose those drawings that seem to lend themselves to a direct application of black-and-white or color mediums. You may find some interesting shadow outlines that can be developed by adding either paint or charcoal to negative (empty) space around the traced outlines or working with your medium into the positive (solid) shapes inside the traced shadow lines.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of this exercise is developing interesting compositions that emphasize the dramatic character of these unusual shapes.</p>

<h3 id="NEGATIVE-SHAPE"><a href="#NEGATIVE-SHAPE" class="headerlink" title="NEGATIVE SHAPE"></a>NEGATIVE SHAPE</h3><p>The painting by Hale Allen showing the silhouettes of electric wires is a good example of how the white negative spaces are as important to the dynamics of this composition as are the black positive shapes that tell us what the thing is in the picture. In other words, it&#8217;s the negative shapes here that keep your eye moving, and that makes this composition a lot more interesting than just a painting of a telephone pole.</p>
<p>Understanding negative space is a primary way of showing you a different avenue to solve the mysteries of perspective, foreshortening and contour drawing without going through more complicated techniques to accomplish the same thing. My purpose is to tap into the potential of using negative space shapes for your abstract work.</p>
<p>The basic process for drawing negative spaces first requires that you see what they look like and find where they&#8217;re hiding. Even before you begin drawing a subject that emphasizes negative space, it&#8217;s important that you draw a rectangular frame around the outer edge of the paper. This border gives you a frame of reference so you can see the shape of a negative space surrounding an object against a clear boundary line. The subject does not have to be in the middle of the border, but the negative space is easier to see this way.</p>
<p>One example that demonstrates negative space is the classic brainteaser illustration showing a picture of a vase rendered in a conventional way alongside of a rendering of the same vase showing only the negative space around the vase.</p>
<p>Depending on how you look at the negative space illustration, you see either the flat outline of the vase or two faces shown in silhouette. This drawing shows how the negative space is easier to see when you create an outside border around an image to better illustrate the shapes of the negative space.</p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-10-Making-a-Positive-From-a-Negative"><a href="#EXERCISE-10-Making-a-Positive-From-a-Negative" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 10: Making a Positive From a Negative"></a>EXERCISE 10: Making a Positive From a Negative</h2><p>The point of this project is first to be able to see and find negative shapes in ordinary things around you and then to create compositions that emphasize and take advantage of those elusive spaces between things that you haven&#8217;t paid much attention to before. The first step is to choose a common object like a chair or stool that has some interesting negative spaces around and inside the form and draw the negative shapes using only line to describe the negative space contours you see.</p>
<p>Seeing the negative spaces depends on the viewing angle you have. For example, drawing a stool that is at eye level and straight in front of you may yield less interesting negative spaces than if you looked at the stool from below or above or turned on an angle offering better negative shapes. Remember we&#8217;re trying to find interesting negative shapes to be the subject of our composition, and you don&#8217;t need to be concerned with rendering the physical things that provide the shapes you&#8217;re drawing. This is a method of extracting the specific contours of unique negative shapes to be used in an abstract composition, and there are no other obligations accompanying that process.</p>
<p>So for our purposes, you don&#8217;t necessarily need to strictly adhere to rendering these shapes with detailed accuracy, but you are looking to trace the uniquely quirky twists and turns and abnormal silhouettes common to negative spaces that make them fascinating as shapes on their own.</p>
<p>You can use the shadow drawing exercise from the previous project as a way to record the negative spaces that surround the dark shadows cast on your paper. Using this method, you can draw as many shapes as you want by moving the paper around and layering different shapes together. Once you&#8217;ve got the shape composition set in line, you can work into those shapes with any materials and colors you wish.</p>

<p>You can also do this project using a digital camera to record interesting negative spaces in the environment. Using a software program like Adobe Photoshop you can exaggerate the negative space by using the Threshold tool to strip away all of the color and gray tones, leaving a stark black-and-white contrast. You can then use your color palette and painting tools to create an infinite variety of computer-generated compositions. You can also choose to print these photos out and use them as a sketch for a composition in another medium.</p>
<p>By the way, anyone who thinks that using photographs in this way is somehow cheating may take it as a clue to leave the cave he&#8217;s been living in for too long.</p>

<h3 id="SHAPE-AND-FORM"><a href="#SHAPE-AND-FORM" class="headerlink" title="SHAPE AND FORM"></a>SHAPE AND FORM</h3><p>It&#8217;s true that the distinctions between shape and form are like two sides of the same coin. It is simply that shapes are flat two-dimensional outlines and forms are sculptural three-dimensional constructs. I wouldn&#8217;t worry if you mix up these two words in a conversation about art (e.g., &#8220;I like the forms you&#8217;re using in this painting&#8221;). Even though the correct word in a two-dimensional painting is <em>shape</em>.</p>
<p>Frankly, no one cares if you use these words interchangeably, and I&#8217;m not trying to add another element to correct your artspeak usage. The reason I&#8217;m making the distinction is so you can make some interesting art by mixing the two together.</p>
<p>For example, Francesca Pastine creates a very interesting composition in her piece <em>Artforum 24</em>, which combines groups of flat contoured shapes that are cut out from an <em>Artforum</em> magazine along with the three-dimensional form made up from the layers themselves in this artwork. Olivia Bernard takes advantage of intriguing flat and dimensional shapes and forms in her <em>Swan Song</em> sculpture.</p>
<p>Similarly, Louise Kohrman creates a unique kind of print/sculpture called <em>Forever in Mind</em> by combining an etching process to make her subtle shapes on paper together with a three-dimensional form structure, which puts an equal emphasis on both shape and form.</p>
<p>The following projects suggest ways you can combine shapes and forms to make some thought-provoking abstract works.</p>

This can be done using any techniques and media as long as the result has some measure of two-dimensional and three-dimensional combinations working together. By the way, this partnership doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be an equal 50/50 distribution. The portions of two-dimensional and three-dimensional involved are totally up for grabs.</p>

The first step in this process is to sketch the outlines of at least ten different shapes on white or colored, heavyweight craft paper using an HB or B grade pencil. You can draw these shapes freehand or use rulers and French curves or a combination of the two. The shapes should be simple geometric and/or organic forms that are spontaneously invented without thinking of how they may look when combined into a three-dimensional form.</p>
<p>Each individual shape you draw should be positioned in the middle of the paper like a paper doll cutout template. Make many more shapes than you think you&#8217;ll need so you&#8217;ll have options when putting them together. These shapes can be reworked and refined using an eraser until you get a form you like.</p>
<p>Once you have at least ten shapes to work with, start cutting them out and fitting them together to see how they work with each other. The goal is to discover new ideas for combining simple shapes together to make dynamic two-dimensional and three-dimensional compositions.</p>
<p>You can also pick out a drawing or painting you did before from your To Be Continued portfolio to use for this project by drawing a shape on top of it, cutting it out and reassembling it as a relief as pictured here.</p>

<h3 id="TEXTURE"><a href="#TEXTURE" class="headerlink" title="TEXTURE"></a>TEXTURE</h3><p>There are so many artists using texture for maximum effect that it&#8217;s difficult to say what&#8217;s the best way to approach it. As with the other basic elements, there&#8217;s usually a mixture that may have color, line, shape, etc. partnering with textural qualities, but I think you can see how distinct the textures are in the examples here. The following project puts texture in the limelight.</p>

The emphasis is on texture itself, so you&#8217;re going to first create a geometric pattern and then use texture to embellish pieces of the pattern to make it more energized and interesting. Of course, <em>more interesting</em> is in the eye of the beholder, but this project gets you to use texture as a tool in your compositions, and it adds to your visual vocabulary overall.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is lay out a simple geometric composition on paper using a light HB or B pencil, in case you decide to change things. The simplest composition to start with may be just a small square, triangle or circle inside a larger square and then fill the empty spaces inside the small square and the space around it with varying textures as shown in these examples. You can use any medium for this, do it spontaneously or make a careful plan, but your goal is to get the most out of your textures.</p>
<p>From that beginning, you can create more elaborate compositions using more complex patterns. There are no limitations to what this pattern may be except to plug texture in it to ramp it up. Those are the basic parameters, but there&#8217;s a lot of room for variation by adding line, color and collage to the mix, which are shown in the examples of my students&#8217; work illustrated here.</p>

<p>This project is not about how to make certain textures but how to find them in your environment for use as inspiration for emphasizing texture in your work.</p>
<p>Textures are all around us in one form or another, and it&#8217;s worthwhile to take your sketchbook or camera outside the studio to see what you can find. When you really look, you can find some extraordinary textures out there like diamonds in the rough.</p>
<p>Using a simple digital camera, you can capture intriguing compositions by zooming in on textures themselves as shown by the examples here. The photos or sketches you make can be used for inspiration to translate into other media or used as the final artwork.</p>

<h3 id="VALUE"><a href="#VALUE" class="headerlink" title="VALUE"></a>VALUE</h3><p>The element of value is an emphasis on gradations of tone from light to dark in a composition. To focus on value itself, you want to create a dynamic contrast between light and dark in your work that translates into a dramatic mood or surreal atmosphere that&#8217;s hard to ignore.</p>
<p>To emphasize value, you often need to call upon tactics of exaggeration and overstatement to create the desired effect. You can see the intense impact of value and contrast in Bruce Fowler&#8217;s photograph of his installation piece and the mixed-media work by Tomas Vu shown here.</p>

The process is to first create a pattern as an outlined sketch and then work strong contrasts of light and dark into your composition to make value the dominant feature. Of course, there is no formula for the task of making a good composition; you just have to lay it out and proceed until you feel it is complete. The examples shown here achieve a powerful contrast of light and dark values that is very impressive.</p>

<h3 id="COLOR"><a href="#COLOR" class="headerlink" title="COLOR"></a>COLOR</h3><p>Color is no doubt the stage star of all the basic elements, and there&#8217;s no question that everyone can relate to having heard the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s your favorite color?&#8221; And regardless of your reluctance to answer, you know you do have a favorite color, don&#8217;t you? By the way, my favorite color is an offbeat variation of Cobalt Blue.</p>
<p>Favorites aside, the list of artists whose works celebrate color can be best measured by the very, very few who you might argue should be excluded from all of us color lovers. Maybe you could say that the all-white paintings of Kazimir Malevich or the all-black paintings of Ad Reinhardt qualify, though they were actually using these noncolors to make an intellectual argument challenging our assumption that color must be part of art.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s possibly the abstract expressionist Franz Kline, most famous for his bold strokes of solidly black paint on a white background, but I&#8217;m sure he would argue that his black-and-white, broom-made brushstokes were a full spectrum of colors hidden in the vial of fast and passionate gestures.</p>
<p>We will be using color in practically every other project of this book; I&#8217;m only listing a couple of projects here where color itself is the prime subject and motivation to make something.</p>

<p>Using the basic concept of colors influencing one another, create color compositions, geometric or organic, emphasizing the interaction of colors that either harmonize or contrast with each other. As before, there are no models for what your final product should look like. The important factor is that you&#8217;re focused on color itself.</p>

This project is another quest to find ready-made color compositions in the environment that you can mine to extract particular colors to use as a base for an abstract composition.</p>
<p>The basic plan is to go out searching for rich colors that are part of places or things you see. For example, it&#8217;s not difficult to find beautiful colors in a bouquet of flowers or the array of colors you see when gazing at a sunset, and this type of subject is fine to use for this project. However, you can make this a more interesting hunt if you try to find colors in unlikely, less pretty places. The example here features a precariously balanced pile of laundry bags I photographed on a back street in Ecuador, which has a full palette of colors to offer (this could also be a source for a texture or line study as well).</p>
<p>You can conduct your search using a camera or a sketchbook, but keep in mind that the primary purpose of this first phase is to seek out colors and not necessarily make an artful photograph or finished painting in your sketchbook.</p>
<p>Once you have six to twelve sketches or photos, pick out the particular colors you think are the most interesting. Mix those colors as separate samples like a color chart and set them aside.</p>
<p>The job from here is to use the colors you mined from your observations to compose a group of abstract works whose palette is taken from your sketches and photographs.</p>

Duchamp was the first artist to designate an ordinary utilitarian object as a work of art simply by selecting it and putting it in an art gallery. Duchamp coined the term <em>readymade</em> for such infamous artworks as <em>Hat Rack, Bottle Rack</em> and <em>Bicycle Wheel</em>. His infamous <em>Fountain urinal,</em> signed R. Mutt 1917, was the kicker that sent the art world over the edge of uncharted territory. By the way, R. Mutt was the name of a plumber that Duchamp found in a phone directory.</p>
<p>Duchamp&#8217;s ready-made magic wand transformed mundane, everyday things into art simply at the behest of the artist, and that revolutionary gesture challenged long-held aesthetic principles that art is strictly confined to things of great beauty and splendor.</p>
<p>Indeed, Duchamp consciously intended to test the limits of what could be considered art as early as 1912, and that battle cry burst through the fortress gates protecting high art from the riffraff of everything else in the world. By now we know that Duchamp, and legions of artists past and present, took up the call to make use of readymades, found objects and anything they could get their hands on to make inventive and intriguing works of art without bothering to get permission from art critics, historians or the ever-vigilant Art Police.</p>
<p>The projects in this section encourage you to take advantage of this artistic license to make art out of whatever you find that inspires you, without fear that it&#8217;s unacceptable to do so. I divided this section into two projects: one that emphasizes finding two-dimensional surfaces that inspire you, and another that works with reconfiguring three-dimensional everyday objects into new art forms.</p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-18-Upgrading-the-Ordinary-and-Everyday"><a href="#EXERCISE-18-Upgrading-the-Ordinary-and-Everyday" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 18: Upgrading the Ordinary and Everyday"></a>EXERCISE 18: Upgrading the Ordinary and Everyday</h2><p>Found object sculptor Peter Dellert says it this way: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a collector all my life and even now when I start a collection I have no idea what it will be for. I am just drawn to the objects, be they cast-off car parts, window weights, tin cans, old atlases, sheet music or scraps from my day job as a cabinetmaker. And although I have no immediate use for them, I truly believe that one day I will need them, find a use for them and be fulfilled in doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem for Peter and other like-minded artists is that they collect things they already think have an aesthetic beauty, albeit from age and decay in many cases, and one doesn&#8217;t want to necessarily do too much to them and compete with the qualities that attracted him in the first place.</p>
<p>Therefore, the task in this project is to find surfaces around you that have their own intrinsic beauty and combine them with your own, subtle techniques of painting, drawing or mixed media that will lead to the final composition.</p>
<p>I suggest the following variations to create artworks inspired by surfaces you find almost anywhere.</p>
<p>Collect flat pieces of paper, metal, wood and other two-dimensional materials to work on directly. For example, you can use an old map you find that has a rich surface comprised of text, color and linear textures that you can work into with any number of materials to transform it into your own composition such as Marsha Westfield did in her mixed-media adaptation of a timeworn French map.</p>
<p>Consider using pencil sketches and photography as a means for appropriating ready-made surface ideas for your abstract works as seen in the charcoal renderings of Carolyn Lyons Horan in the next chapter on realism and abstraction.</p>
<p>The advent of digital photography has made it much easier to use your camera or smartphone, and less cumbersome than toting sketch materials around, so you can quickly record subjects whenever they come up. Readymade subjects like graffiti and surfaces of all kinds are there for your handy camera to record.</p>

Janet Stupak and I have collected damaged old books from the trash and thrift shops for a long time in order to repurpose them for our art. In Janet&#8217;s <em>Picasso</em> you see the recycled remnants of a water-damaged copy of a book on Picasso, combined with the spines of other discarded books that make up her abstract/realistic collage. Recycling discarded objects like this is a side benefit of found-object art.</p>

Though there&#8217;s no particular message intended here, this abstract sculpture looks like a ceremonial artifact that was unearthed in an ancient cave. All the more interesting when you look closely and discover that it&#8217;s not made of treasures like gold and silver, but humble ingredients taken off the family dinner table. Consequently, this project is a challenge to find readymades in commercial locations that you can adapt for abstract art.</p>

The chair has been a practical necessity throughout human history. The evolution of its design is as diverse as the clothes worn from the distant past to the present day. Though chairs are made to be comfortable places to sit, many artists and designers have made their name through their revolutionary ideas that bring together a beautiful form with masterful construction of a new, yet unforeseen, outcome.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to deconstruct a commonplace chair and remake it into a dynamic piece of sculpture. First, find a wooden or plastic chair at a tag sale or secondhand store or find one on the street for free. Try to find a chair with some characteristic shapes, contours, colors or textures that appeal to you. Make some observations of this chair.</p>
<p>Is it a good subject because it&#8217;s a plain and ordinary chair lacking character on first observation? Is it more functional, more practical or more decorative? Where was this chair meant to be used? Next, think of how you can disassemble this chair and make it nonfunctional. How can you change this chair and give it an artistic and expressive form?</p>
<p>Start by taking the chair apart. Obviously, do this with safety in mind, but also do this slowly as you may want to keep some main components as they are. Once you&#8217;ve removed the parts you want to change, begin reconstructing the chair using artistic considerations of composition and form dynamics as the primary goals.

This is not to say that C&#233;zanne discovered how to make nature look abstract in his paintings, as that was never his intent. In fact, he wasn&#8217;t consciously trying to change the way nature looked in his work at all. Rather, he was focused on what the painting itself needed to be&#8212;an artwork inspired by nature yet not obligated to simply recreate her straightforward appearances.</p>
<p>To do that, he first had to relinquish the bonds of commitment to rendering what he saw in the natural world exactly how it appeared.</p>
<p>The second idea he came upon was to pay more attention to the painting itself in order to translate his impressions of nature into a new entity that was evolving and changing as if it had its own voice demanding to be heard. That change&#8212;to focus attention on the compositional needs of the artwork itself&#8212;was a radical departure from what any other artist of his time was doing, and it was the precursor to generations of artists who followed his lead.</p>
<p><em>Abstract art has been with us in one form or another for almost a century now and has proved to be not only a long-standing crux of cultural debate but a self-renewing, vital tradition of creativity. We know that it works, even if we&#8217;re still not sure why that&#8217;s so or exactly what to make of that fact.</em> &#8212;Kirk Varnedoe, <em>Pictures of Nothing: Abstract Art Since Pollock</em></p>

<p>During a discussion concerning C&#233;zanne and the question &#8220;What is real and what is abstract in art?&#8221;, a former professor of mine suggested that, if I wasn&#8217;t sure about the difference between real and abstract, I might want to try to take a bite out of a C&#233;zanne apple to see how it tastes.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can&#8217;t take a bite of a C&#233;zanne apple unless you&#8217;d like a mouthful of very bitter, dried-up paint, not to mention being tossed in jail.</p>
<p>The fact is, a painting of an apple, or a picture of anything else for that matter, is born to the mastery of artistic magicians who can create the illusion of a three-dimensional reality on a two-dimensional surface. The irony is that this long tradition of creating the illusion of real things in the world on a piece of paper or stretched canvas is its own form of abstraction universally practiced by all artists&#8212;painters, sculptors and even photographers&#8212;regardless of their objectives to accurately depict things in the visible world. It may be art, but it&#8217;s always an abstracted invention by an artist interpreting the real world as she sees it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m not from the elitist camp that says, &#8220;If you can find something recognizable in a composition&#8212;usually a face or something more provocative&#8212;it&#8217;s not a pure abstraction.&#8221; After all, if astrologers, some of the world&#8217;s early abstract thinkers, can draw a charioteer riding behind three wild stallions by connecting the points of seven distant stars, we owe a debt to our artistic imagination as the real driving force of human creativity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not a big fan of the art audience that declares, &#8220;Picasso had earned the right to paint abstractly since he was a master of realism to begin with.&#8221; Picasso himself disputed this idea saying that he wished he had come to know his inner-child spirit of bold creativity sooner than he did in his abstract works. That said, I don&#8217;t want to lecture away the fascinating connections that exist between realism and abstraction, which offer so many opportunities to excite your instincts to try new artistic horizons.</p>
<p>What I do want to do is exploit this collision of contrasts as an avenue to explore the creative possibilities that can include elements of both realist and abstract artistic traditions.</p>
<p>Though I haven&#8217;t taken a poll, I would wager that there are more artists working now who would agree with the premise that their art is both realistic <em>and</em> abstract. In fact, I think there&#8217;s more interest today in making art that is kind of a bilingual expression of the desire to span both worlds.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that you shouldn&#8217;t think of these projects as a way to make something in the world just look abstract. That&#8217;s my complaint about many other how-to books on abstract art&#8212;that they&#8217;re too focused on a narrow stereotype for what abstract art typically looks like.</p>
<p>By contrast, I want you to see the endless variety of possibilities for what your abstract work can look like, and most of that variety comes directly from your own unique personality and how you express what you see in the environment around you.</p>

<p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, J.M.W. Turner for short (1775&#8211;1851), was, in my mind, one of the most inspiring and influential abstract artists in the history of painting. Turner was a master realist, a classical landscape painter, in his day. That is, until he discovered the newest technology of the early nineteenth century&#8212;the medium of watercolor. Not only did watercolor free Turner to sketch and record nature without worrying about oils not drying in a timely fashion, watercolors gave him the ability to spontaneously record his impressions of sunlit scenes in fleeting moments of time that eventually dubbed him &#8220;the painter of light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the fact that his work proved to be an important influence on Impressionists many years later, Turner&#8217;s watercolors cut to the core of what it means to abstractly interpret nature as a living, breathing entity, right down to reading the full-sensory qualities of temperature, smell, touch and even taste in a few effortless brushstrokes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Turner ever fully understood the implications of the transformation he had undergone as an artist, nor was he self-consciously invested in taking a place in art history as a rebel proclaiming to be the inventor of a new kind of art. Simply put, Turner&#8217;s passion was to reach under the surface of things to find another level of consciousness he could only access through painting. John Cage once identified this process of abstraction saying, &#8220;I prefer to interpret nature in her manner of operation rather than her outward appearances.&#8221;</p>
<p>The irony is that Turner is a unique example of a &#8220;na&#239;ve&#8221; artist whose career spiraled in reverse gear. He begins as a child prodigy with incredible technical skills to render and illustrate classical iconography only to abandon that craft once he saw the opportunities to capture the abstract essence of nature by letting go, painting what he felt and sensed in his gut. Inspirational indeed!</p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-22-Sharing-the-Spotlight"><a href="#EXERCISE-22-Sharing-the-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 22: Sharing the Spotlight"></a>EXERCISE 22: Sharing the Spotlight</h2><p>When working from observed subject matter, the central idea is to see beyond the name of what you&#8217;re looking at&#8212;whether it&#8217;s a still life, a figure or a building&#8212;to find the qualities you want to dramatize and transform. This process of observation is similar to projects in the first chapter, which centered on making use of basic elements where you are accentuating a color, line, shape, form, value or texture that you want to bring to the forefront.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&#8217;re looking at a subject such as a tree, you want to see that tree through the lens of these basic elements, rather than see it as a static object you already have an icon for in your head.</p>
<p>This is a very different kind of observation that needs to come from your art brain, looking for the uniquely aesthetic elements that comprise the tree and not your cosmopolitan brain just seeking a tree for shade on a hot day.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to train your art brain to see more clearly, to look deeper at the world for the benefit of any realistic or abstract art objectives you may have.</p>
<p>This first project centers on training your eye to look close-up at segments of the world from different perspectives to see the potential for creating abstract art hidden from casual observations. To do this, select an object to zoom in on, taking a macro view of what you see to use as your subject.</p>
<p>For example, Tyler Vouros&#8217;s composition of a sunflower uses a close-up view to transform his observation into a dramatic abstract version of the object. In addition to a zoomed-in view, part of the drama here comes from high-contrast black and white charcoal in place of color. The result is an intriguing marriage of the real thing he&#8217;s looking at and the dramatic effects of the close-up view and stark contrast. This is realism and abstraction working together as equal partners.</p>
<p>This process of zooming in on something aids in the process of seeing that something differently, and that&#8217;s the main objective of this exercise. There are many ways to abstractly transform what you see simply by looking at the world from your art brain&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>Note how the sunflower and seashell compositions were inspired by taking a close-up view of the subject. Digital photography and smart phone technology have made it possible to always have a camera with you, ready to capture a scene on the spur of the moment. Using a camera is the best way to capture fleeting moments where light and shadow change the look of a scene over time or when studying moving cloud formations and changing weather. Another advantage of using a camera is that you can take many photos in a short period of time (that&#8217;s more difficult to sketch by hand). By the way, selfies don&#8217;t count for this project.</p>

After you&#8217;ve painted wine bottles and grapes or a sunset in Cadmium Orange and Yellow for the one-hundredth time or you&#8217;ve made yet another Pollock-esque drip work or minimal, one-color composition, they kind of lose their appeal, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>My view is that there is no such thing as an intrinsically wonderful subject with a monopoly on personal satisfaction and creative significance when making art.</p>
<p>So what do you do to break this habit of relying on traditional subject matter? When you&#8217;re stuck looking for inspiration, simply look around you to see the potential in ordinary objects or parts of your environment. A key factor in this approach is enlisting the help of your innate curiosity. Nothing is boring to the artist who practices responding to what he sees with a fully engaged imagination.</p>
<p>If the subject isn&#8217;t coming to life in front of you, take the creative challenge to make it more interesting than it appears. After all, the idea to make reality more interesting is the true calling for all artists.</p>
<p>There are many approaches to take with this project. To begin with you must look for something different than whatever you&#8217;re used to drawing or painting. I recommend looking up around the ceiling or down near the ground rather than searching at eye level. Eye level is OK as long as you don&#8217;t compose a still life of familiar objects you&#8217;re already comfortable drawing. (This project works better out of your comfort zone.)</p>
<p>Remember, you&#8217;re looking for new ideas in commonplace settings. You can make this into an art scavenger hunt by looking for accidental compositions that no one else is paying attention to. I found an interesting composition of light fixtures when I looked up in a building that was being renovated. While on a walk in the woods I came upon a great composition of tree roots and dried leaves that was inspiring.</p>
<p>Of course, you could have a rich photo itself be the final artwork as it combines realism and abstraction in a unique way just as it is. You could also transform the photo in an editing program as I did, using the Threshold function to create a high-contrast pattern of textures and rhythm of lines. This is another method of extracting abstract forms from the realistic observation.</p>
<p>I had my students go into a downtown area and make sketches from what they saw in store windows. Here you have a treasure trove of interesting objects, shapes, colors and textures that have already been arranged for you by someone who thought they were just making an interesting display to attract customers.</p>
<p>Once you see something interesting, start making quick thumbnail drawings with line only or take a quick picture, but keep it simple. Don&#8217;t start working into anything until you&#8217;ve got at least ten to twenty sketches with potential to take further.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can always use a digital camera or smart phone as a quick way to record places or objects of interest, rather than drawing. You would then use the photos to draw or paint from later.</p>
<p>Once you have your sketches, look through them for places to start and get going on your drawing, painting or sculpture from there.</p>

Carolyn Horan did this by first photographing a group of shadows on the ground, a form of abstraction created naturally. She then created an abstract charcoal composition, which was an interpretation of the shadows she had photographed earlier.</p>
<p>Carolyn&#8217;s drawing is fairly true to the photograph she took since she faithfully recorded the shapes, values and textures she saw in the camera&#8217;s image. The irony is that the photograph itself reads as an abstraction because there&#8217;s very little there to reveal that this is sunlight peering through leaves, again demonstrating how realism and abstraction can be interchangeable aspects of the same thing.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can approach this project, including finding your own abstract organic form to photograph and then using it as a source for a composition in another medium, or reverse the process and create an abstract drawing or painting and search your natural surroundings to photograph something in nature that looks similar to the composition you made earlier.</p>

Eric is not alone in his love of working on the edges of both realism and abstraction. There are many well-known artists&#8212;J.M.W. Turner, Claude Monet, Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe, to name a few&#8212;who would paint and draw directly from observed nature, extracting something of the essence of what they saw into a newly created abstract image.</p>
<p>When many of us make art, we are in our studio&#8212;albeit in our attic, basement or at a kitchen table&#8212;hibernating there even when the weather is ideal to go outside. I&#8217;m sure many realist painters follow the long-standing tradition of plein air painting and drawing by going out into the elements, but you&#8217;re unlikely to see many artists these days who are making nonrepresentational images by braving the elements to find and observe their subjects outdoors.</p>
<p>I had a student in an advanced painting class who was struggling to paint a seascape from memory. He said he had lived near the ocean all his life and felt he should have been able to make a more accurate depiction of the sea he knows than the one he was churning out. When I asked him if he had actually gone out and sketched or painted the ocean much, he said, &#8220;No.&#8221; To me this is the equivalent of assuming you should be able to play golf because you lived next to a golf course. Clearly, you can&#8217;t expect to know a subject through some process of osmosis; you have to study it to gain knowledge.</p>
<p>As with the last project, you need to inform your art brain by physically and mentally looking at your subject to retain as much as you can about what you see. And since those artists who prefer to work abstractly are among the most handicapped for their lack of experience working directly on location, I highly recommend getting yourself outside as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You may get more food for thought if you are searching for gritty, unusual scenes to work from rather than those that are pretty. One of the advantages of working with cityscapes is that there are plenty of tattered facades of old buildings, back-alley trash and junkyard chaos to work from that you won&#8217;t find in a more pristine landscape.</p>
<p>By the way, it isn&#8217;t necessarily better to make finished works outdoors in order to earn your art merit badge for getting it done in one sitting. Artist Charles Burchfield famously went out in Buffalo, New York, blizzards and painted until he and his brushes were frozen and snowflakes created ghosts in his watercolors&#8212;a true Olympian of plein air painting!</p>
<p>While completing your work on-site is a good ambition, I recommend that you simply make a habit of sketching outside as a way to expand your artistic vocabulary for what&#8217;s out there to use in your art.</p>
<p>Outdoor landscape painting became popular with the advent of portable media like charcoal, graphite and watercolors starting in the early eighteenth century. Today you have options to use acrylic paints, watercolors, water-based oils and dry media such as pastels, colored pencils and oil bars, allowing you to create your composition on the spot if that&#8217;s what you wish to do.</p>

Though their intentions were more about testing the boundaries of art beyond the gallery walls, they also demonstrated the possibilities for creating a new abstract art form that combined organic and inorganic elements introduced into the environment, changing our perception of a scene from picturesque to something abstractly surreal.</p>
<p>Chris Nelson&#8217;s <em>Inside Out</em> earthwork is a good example of how the temporary introduction of a polypropylene rope suspended over a granite quarry, with no practical function, makes a dramatic change in how we think about what we see. The work exists as an event during the time it&#8217;s up and with photo documentation once the rope is removed. The resulting artwork is a kind of collaboration between the artist and Mother Nature. There&#8217;s lots of room to explore the vast opportunities to partner with natural elements to create abstract art yourself.</p>

<p>Two people sit or stand back-to-back, one having a sketch pad and a box of crayons, and the other talking out loud about what she sees from her opposite vantage point.</p>
<p>The describer can say only what she sees in terms of the basic elements&#8212;line, shape, color, texture, value and form (from chapter one)&#8212;without using the names of things she sees in the landscape&#8212;rocks, grass, trees, people, dogs, etc. The describer can use emotional inflections and adjectives to describe what she sees such as turbulent lines, bright colors, soft shapes and the like, as long as she doesn&#8217;t say what something is.</p>
<p>The drawer must use his crayons and imagination to render what the describer is saying without resorting to using any symbols, words or images of things in his abstract picture.</p>
<p>Each partner takes a turn playing the role of the describer or the drawer, and there is no time limit assigned to switch places.</p>
<p>I know this sounds a lot like the classic game show <em>Password</em>, but in this case there is no correct answer to the question, so what should the resulting drawing look like? That&#8217;s what makes this project so creative and fun to do!</p>

Some of the most noted are: Impressionism (c. 1870&#8211;1890), Postimpressionism (c. 1885&#8211;1905), Fauvism (c. 1905&#8211;1910), German Expressionism (c. 1905&#8211;1925), Cubism (c. 1907&#8211;1915), Futurism (c. 1909&#8211;1914), Suprematism (c. 1915&#8211;1925), Constructivism (c. 1913&#8211;1930), Dadaism (c. 1916&#8211;1922), Surrealism (c. 1924&#8211;1939), Abstract Expressionism (c. 1946&#8211;1956) and Minimalism (1969&#8211;). I&#8217;m sure that historians would argue for several other modern <em>isms</em> before, in between and after these benchmarks that are part of the legacy in the evolution of abstract art.</p>
<p>Each of these movements has some distinct characteristics making it unique from the others, but I&#8217;m more interested in the base philosophy tying them together than I am in their relative differences.</p>
<p>The strongest example of the underlying unity in abstract art is the fact that the act of making abstract art is itself an affirmation of an artist&#8217;s ability to think and imagine beyond the social and political norms that would confine us to a more boxed-in world that sets limits on what&#8217;s acceptable in art.</p>
<p>The following projects borrow ideas from some of the richest abstract art movements, which have plenty more room to expand on. The movements I selected are Impressionism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism.</p>

<h2 id="IMPRESSIONISM"><a href="#IMPRESSIONISM" class="headerlink" title="IMPRESSIONISM"></a>IMPRESSIONISM</h2><p>The Impressionists searched for a more exact analysis of the effects of color and light in nature. They sought to capture the atmosphere of a particular time of day or the effects of different weather conditions. They often worked outdoors and applied their paint in small brightly colored strokes, which meant sacrificing much of the outline and detail of their subject.</p>
<p>Impressionism abandoned the conventional idea that the color of an object&#8217;s shadow was comprised of that object&#8217;s color with some brown or black added.</p>
<p>Instead, the Impressionists enriched their colors with the idea that a shadow is broken up with dashes of the object&#8217;s complementary color.</p>
<p>Among the most important Impressionist painters were Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste-Renoir, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.</p>
<p>Postimpressionism was not a particular style of painting; it was the collective title given to the works of a few independent artists at the end of the nineteenth century. The Postimpressionists rebelled against the limitations of Impressionism to develop a range of personal styles that influenced the development of art in the twentieth century. The major artists associated with Postimpressionism were Paul C&#233;zanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.</p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-28-Recording-Your-Impressions"><a href="#EXERCISE-28-Recording-Your-Impressions" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 28: Recording Your Impressions"></a>EXERCISE 28: Recording Your Impressions</h2><p>The Impressionists were devoted to observing nature from a unique perspective, and it is that selective eye on nature that made their visions unique. The Impressionists didn&#8217;t consider themselves to be abstract artists. To the contrary, they were devotees of painting the glory of nature in all her splendor.</p>
<p>The thing that set them apart was how they applied their selective eye, choosing to emphasize qualities of light over a multitude of other aspects of nature.</p>
<p>This project borrows from the Impressionists&#8217; emphasis on the transformative qualities of sunlight and shadow&#8212;key elements in their art. The main emphasis of this project is to use qualities of extreme contrasts of light and shadow, along with an inventive color palette in your abstract compositions.</p>
<p>The simple subjects here are light and shadow and your goal is to emphasize how sunlight, or the lack of it, alters your perception of the world. You&#8217;re not trying to illustrate an Impressionistic style of picture making in this project. Rather, you are creating your own compositions emphasizing your subjective impressions of light and shadow filtered through a combination of your observation and imagination.</p>
<p>This exercise works best when done from direct observation outdoors by making sketches or taking pictures to gather ideas as we&#8217;ve done in previous projects. Though you can do this project strictly out of your head, it&#8217;s most helpful to have direct observation as a basis for your impressionistic compositions.</p>
<p>So go out and search for evidence of light affecting objects, structures or vistas that you can document or take note of, and develop your sketches into a variety of compositions in different media. Keep in mind that there is not one solution to this project and the more compositions you make, the better.</p>

<h3 id="CUBISM"><a href="#CUBISM" class="headerlink" title="CUBISM"></a>CUBISM</h3><p>Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque invented Cubism around 1907, and it was the first abstract style of modern art. Cubist paintings ignore the traditions of perspective drawing and show you many views of a subject at one time.</p>
<p>The Cubists believed that the traditions of Western art had become exhausted, and to revitalize their work, they drew on the expressive energy of art from other cultures, particularly African art.</p>
<p>There are two distinct phases of the Cubist style: Analytical Cubism (pre-1912) and Synthetic Cubism (post-1912). Analytical cubism saw the artist analyze a subject from many different viewpoints and reconstruct it within a crude geometric framework. The overall effect was to create an image that evoked a sense of the subject as a fragmented form unified by the use of a subdued and limited palette of colors.</p>
<p>Around 1912 the styles of Picasso and Braque were becoming predictable. Their images had grown so similar that their paintings of this period are often difficult to tell apart. Their work was increasingly abstract and less recognizable as a figure, still life or landscape. In an attempt to revitalize the style, Picasso began to glue printed images from the real world onto the surface of his still lifes. Influenced by the introduction of bold and simple collage shapes, Synthetic Cubism moved away from the unified monochrome surfaces of Analytic Cubism to a more direct, colorful and decorative style.</p>
<p>Cubism influenced many other styles of modern art, including Expressionism, Futurism, Orphism, Vorticism, Suprematism, Constructivism and De Stijl. Other notable artists associated with Cubism were Juan Gris, Fernand L&#233;ger, Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Louis Marcoussis and Marie Laurencin.</p>
<p>One little-known fact about Cubism is that it was the inspiration behind the fragmented views of earth, foliage, branches and grass that came to be known as camouflage, first used in World War I.</p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-29-Working-With-a-Fractured-Reality"><a href="#EXERCISE-29-Working-With-a-Fractured-Reality" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 29: Working With a Fractured Reality"></a>EXERCISE 29: Working With a Fractured Reality</h2><p>Cubism may be the most iconic art movement associated with the invention of abstract art since it caused such a stir when it was first shown in art galleries in the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Cubism was not as subtle a transformation of reality as Impressionism&#8212;boldly taking a picture apart and rearranging it into something that had no resemblance to what was thought of as reality. It was artistic blasphemy!</p>
<p>By today&#8217;s standards, Cubism seems pretty tame, but the idea of fragmenting an image to create a new abstract composition still has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>For this project, I&#8217;d like you to keep the following two parameters in mind to keep this project related to Cubism as distinct from other forms of painting and collage:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Your composition could pictorially represent a single subject, or multiple subjects, from many different viewpoints at the same time and reconstruct it within one geometric framework. This may be done as one flat picture painted with the ambiguous illusion of three-dimensional space that depicts different overlapping views at the same time.</li>
<li>You may approach the same general idea of representing multiple geometric views and conflicting ambiguous space by collaging different pieces of your own work together.<br>Of course, I won&#8217;t be checking your work to see if your Cubist creation meets a litmus test, but do try to keep these suggestions in mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>That still leaves a lot of open territory to consider what you want to do, but don&#8217;t just sit there and debate what Cubism is, just get going by making something!</p>
<p>This project, like many others in this book, can be a two-dimensional composition, a mixed-media work or constructed with three-dimensional materials.</p>
<p>Rather than using the standard newspaper and magazine cutouts to collage, I recommend that you take apart some of your own old drawings, paintings and photographs and recombine them into abstract images. The obvious reason is that your own work is more personally connected than pieces created by someone else.</p>
<p>The best resource for images to use for this project are artworks you&#8217;ve made that were either unfinished or discarded because you didn&#8217;t like them. Once you&#8217;ve located several of your own compositions that you&#8217;re willing to sacrifice for this project, start cutting or tearing up the images and make a pile of the ones that look most interesting.</p>

<h3 id="ABSTRACT-EXPRESSIONISM"><a href="#ABSTRACT-EXPRESSIONISM" class="headerlink" title="ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM"></a>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM</h3><p>Abstract Expressionism was the first great American avant-garde art movement. It began shortly after World War II in the late 1940s and flourished in the 1950s and 1960s The roots of Abstract Expressionism go back to the original master, Wassily Kandinsky, who was the first well-known artist to declare that his paintings were centered in his inner world and not related to painting the visible aspects of nature. Other influences came from the Cubists, Futurists and particularly Surrealists, who opened new, unexplored horizons in art, stimulated by the movement to break out of the realist conventions of the day.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known Abstract Expressionist was Jackson Pollock because of his dramatic personality on the canvas and in the public eye. His dripping and spattering painting techniques brought him fame as the master of pure emotional expression in art.</p>
<p>The movement can be more or less divided into two groups: Action Painting, typified by artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Philip Guston, who stressed the physical action involved in painting; and Color Field Painting, practiced by Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb and Kenneth Noland among others, were primarily concerned with exploring the effects of pure color on a canvas.</p>
<p>I took the preceding list off the Internet, and it reads like the stereotyped boy&#8217;s club that dominates the Who&#8217;s Who in art history. Not that the recognition of these male artists is unwarranted, but you have to dig down pretty far to see that artists like Louise Bourgeois, Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe, Helen Frankenthaler and Joan Mitchell were making equally provocative art right alongside their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Probably the most egregious example of a woman artist being relegated to art history footnotes is Lee Krasner, wife of Jackson Pollock, whose own potent paintings were way ahead of the curve for Abstract Expressionist innovators. We now know that Krasner was a significant influence on Pollock himself, and she likely made the first free-form drip paintings that sparked Pollock&#8217;s grand gestures and made such a lasting impression on the art world.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make mention of these facts to chide historians for overlooking women artists or just to sound politically correct. I&#8217;m using that clear example of art history prejudice to point out that there is no gender, no race, no group of art manifestos that owns the keys to what&#8217;s most important and relevant in the realm of making art.</p>
<p>What is most relevant is that the choice to make art is open to absolutely everyone without exception, and the politics of who&#8217;s best at it is a trivial pursuit that&#8217;s a distraction from taking up your own opportunities to make art in a way that&#8217;s meaningful to you.</p>
<p><em>There are &#8220;elements of nature&#8221; in my work, but not in the sense of birds and trees and water. When I say &#8220;nature&#8221; I might mean energy, motion, everything that&#8217;s happening in and around me. That&#8217;s what I mean by nature.</em> &#8212; Lee Krasner quoted by Gail Levin, <em>Lee Krasner: A Biography</em></p>

Just saying it doesn&#8217;t necessarily work. So my main direction to you is to trust your intuition; start a composition and keep going.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear just by looking at the examples I&#8217;ve included with this project that they are Abstract Expressionist artworks. Only the artist really knows whether he is working strictly from gut instincts. You have to assume those who view your work may or may not get that; it goes with the territory.</p>
<p>This is also a project that could lead you to think that Abstract Expressionism means a lot of dripping, pouring and generally frantic-looking marks are all over the place. While that can be true, many kinds of compositions that take many different forms, originate from a deeply emotional source.</p>
<p>The action painting project that I described in chapter one under Icebreakers and Warm-Ups, is a good specific way to work spontaneously without over-thinking what you are making.</p>
<p>Artist Barbara Moody says it this way: &#8220;The elements of unpredictability and surprise are the driving forces in my abstract work. I&#8217;m drawn to contrasts between density and airiness, spontaneity and deliberateness, transparency and opacity, hints of representation and abstraction, and between what just occurred and what will happen next. The automatic drawing process feels all-encompassing to me, like being inside of the work itself.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="Creative-Meditations-8212-The-Tao-of-Abstract-Art"><a href="#Creative-Meditations-8212-The-Tao-of-Abstract-Art" class="headerlink" title="Creative Meditations &#8212; The Tao of Abstract Art"></a>Creative Meditations &#8212; The Tao of Abstract Art</h2><p>Christopher Willingham, Adjunct Professor of Art, Holyoke Community College, created the haiku and koan projects in this section.</p>
<p>The intention of directed contemplation in Eastern meditation is to accept the nature of impermanence and change. The purpose of meditative practice is to recognize knowledge as emerging from emptiness, and that inspiration and insight can occur when we silently surrender ourselves to simply what is. Without accepting what is, we attach to distractions and often misplace the possibility of transformation&#8212;an intuitive, inward understanding of the process of life itself.</p>
<p>In art we can apply these principles to the creative process. This is useful because it helps us get out of our own way as we make the work. This approach is open, intuitive and spontaneous and is about discovering the image or object as it emerges and develops moment to moment.</p>
<p>What is most required is curiosity, trust in one&#8217;s own inner resources and a willingness to recognize and respond to what happens in the present-tense act of making art. The results can be uniquely fresh, inspired and personal.</p>
<p>The captivating world of the subconscious mind and all we know of the subterranean depths of our dreams are fertile grounds for making abstract art. The hitch is that we tend to spend so much wasted time debating what is real and what is pure fantasy that we miss the creative opportunities afforded by letting go of our personal comfort zones. In order to change that stigma from an obstacle to an opportunity, this section challenges you to find inspiration in the fact that your subjective internal visions, dreams and meditations can have a great, positive influence on your abilities to create beyond the physical world around you.</p>
<p><em>The public has been misled into believing that art is an invention, a creation from nothing by a solitary genius working in a vacuum. Art, like life, which it reflects, is continuity. For a painter the true meaning of painting is in the act of painting.</em> &#8212;Alexander Liberman, <em>The Artist in His Studio</em></p>

<p>Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry using a set of three lines that follow a pattern of 5/7/5 syllables. Subjects of haiku poems are often events, seasons and creatures of the natural world that reflect a distinctive Zen and Buddhist sensibility. The haiku poet records experience by using a meditative thought process that leaves the mind open to subconscious influences.</p>
<p>This intuitive writing process is akin to the same form of open imagination visual artists use to create their work. Use your subconscious imagination to interpret haiku poems visually.</p>
<p>You may choose one of the following haiku poems to serve as an inspiration for your drawing or painting, use another haiku or poem by someone else or write your own haiku for this project.</p>
<p>You are not trying to illustrate the landscape, things or ideas mentioned in the poem. Rather, use the sounds and sensory impressions you receive and imagine from reading the poem as your inspiration. Remember, too, that there is no right way to interpret a poem, and your artwork can and should be different from another artist using the same poem as inspiration.</p>

Koan consists of elements that contradict or are inaccessible to a rational understanding of the world, but that encourage intuitive contemplation beyond the surface of what we see.</p>
<p>Often the purpose of the koan is to jolt the mind into a new state of awareness by confounding conventional thoughts and interpretations of the mundane experience of our environment.</p>
<p>One well-known koan is the Original Face, which takes the form of the question, &#8220;What did your face look like before your parents were born?&#8221; This question invites us to recognize essence as the empty nature of reality&#8212;an essential emptiness that consists of all potential beyond any particulars of social, cultural, physical or psychological understandings of self, body and mind. This cultivated understanding of an essence that is beyond (and prior to) form and material manifestation is common to Zen, Buddhist and Taoist teaching and practice.</p>
<p>As an artistic meditation, we will use this question to reconsider our self-perceptions in the form of a self-portrait series.</p>
<p>Make four self-portrait drawings, using the koan of the Original Face to help you focus in the act of this artistic meditation. Let the question be a vehicle for contemplation to help you respond intuitively in the process of making these drawings. You will attempt to recognize and express the essence of your Original Face by studying yourself in four reflections to follow.</p>
<p>For this project, you may use any support surface and media you prefer, and they need not be the same for each portrait. Note that you may use mediums such as photography for your koan portrait as well as any drawing or painting techniques.</p>

His book <em>Notations</em> shows over one hundred musical scores that don&#8217;t use traditional musical notation to tell the musicians what notes to play or how they should use their instruments.</p>
<p>Well-known composers, musicians, artists, writers, movie directors and other individuals made these drawings, paintings, flowcharts, maps, scrawls and written directions from diverse backgrounds. The thing I like most about this book (unfortunately out of print) is marveling at these intriguing abstract artworks and, by switching my brain around, thinking about how these &#8220;scores&#8221; could be played by musicians and what that may have sounded like.</p>
<p>As an opening to some of my lectures on abstract art, I demonstrate how some abstract paintings of mine and others may sound if you were to vocalize the volume of a work&#8217;s shapes, lines and textures and intonate the intensities of a color&#8217;s hues and values. But frankly, that stand-up bit is the best way I know to interject some humor into a lecture by putting the audience and myself at ease with what I&#8217;m saying about abstract art. It must ring the right bell, however, since I got an ovation when I performed that interpretation in front of five hundred Chinese art students at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing. Cage would have been proud!</p>
<p>The project I&#8217;m proposing here is that you take up the challenge posed by Cage&#8217;s invitation to create a visual score that is specifically intended to be played as music. At this stage you don&#8217;t necessarily have to have a musician waiting in the wings to perform your composition, because you&#8217;re making this piece thinking about it abstractly in the same way you may think about making an abstract composition about a poem, as you did previously.</p>
<p>A variation you could explore is to start by listening to a musical composition that inspires you to create the artwork. As an example, I created <em>Painting Arabesque #1</em> in response to Debussy&#8217;s composition by the same name.</p>

This event can be performed by a group of artists and musicians working toward a gallery event, or can be an innovative project for high school or college art and music classes to add to their curriculum.</p>
<p>The steps in this group project are as follows:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The artists and musicians have preliminary meetings to discuss the process of creating visual scores for musicians to interpret and then to determine a plan for adapting their art forms to this goal.</li>
<li>There are several follow-up meetings of these groups over a one- to six-month time frame in order to be prepared for their performance and exhibit. At those meetings, artists can show examples of their work to the musicians, and the musicians can explain how their instruments work and demonstrate playing them for the artists.</li>
<li>At the time of the scheduled performance the artists stage an exhibition of the visual scores they created and the musicians play these compositions. The recital could feature individual musicians performing their visual scores, and possibly an improvised orchestral concert could complete the event.</li>

As she explains, &#8220;Recently, I have begun translating weather data collected in cities into musical scores, which are then translated into sculptures as well as being a source for collaboration with musicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;These pieces are not only devices that map meteorological conditions of a specific time and place, but are also functional musical scores to be played by musicians. While musicians have freedom to interpret, they are asked not to change the essential relationship of the notes to ensure that what is still heard is indeed the meteorological relationship of weather data.&#8221; (Nathalie Miebach website: <a href="http://www.nathaliemiebach.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.nathaliemiebach.com</a>)</p>
<p>Another artist who works from information systems is Ann Tarantino, who comments, &#8220;I reference different kinds of systems in my work, from the delicate patterning of nervous tissue revealed through brain cell stains, to the emotional ties revealed through contemporary social networks, to the intricate webs of relationships required to maintain healthy ecosystems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The work by both of these artists is not only beautiful and ingenious, it opens up yet another vast territory for abstract art. That territory is information. It can be any kind of information from science, history, animal life, climate change or the daily news that can be transformed into a visual composition: a drawing, painting, sculpture, installation or performance.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is for you to determine a body of information you want to translate into an abstract artwork. Again, this can be an artwork in any medium and you don&#8217;t need to model it after any other artist&#8217;s work.</p>

The next time you feel squeamish about trying something new in art, remember that there are no actual obstacles preventing you from fully expressing yourself except for those swimming around in your head.</p>
<p>I teach a class called &#8220;Stop Whining and Draw,&#8221; and it&#8217;s one of the most popular workshops I teach. I think the reason for that popularity is that so many artists know they spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about the same old stuff: <em>What&#8217;s a good subject to paint? Will people like this piece? Will this work be any good?</em></p>
<p>Deliberations of questions like those are classic art-moaning thoughts that take the place of <em>art making</em>, and conceding to our own artistic angst is always a huge waste of time!</p>
<p>The following projects are designed to reinforce the focus on the process of making art and keep you moving ahead while renewing your enthusiasm for nurturing your creativity.</p>
<p><em>I want to paint the birth of things, to represent the act, the effort of creation. It is more important than the painting. The painting&#8212;it is up to the spectator to make it. The artist must work with the thought that the spectator can understand things half said, not completely described. Just because the spectator is slow, the artist does not have to be slow.</em> &#8212;Alexander Liberman, <em>The Artist in His Studio</em></p>

The choice of an art medium like oil or acrylic paint, watercolors or simple compressed charcoal may be just a matter of convenience that gets the desired effect in our art, but for many of us, certain art materials have the right stuff: the way they feel when we&#8217;re working, the way they look in the finished product and even how they smell. This &#8220;stuff&#8221; heightens our passion for the creative process.</p>
<p>That sensation may be the gussy texture and aroma of pure oil paint, the delicate feel of watercolors or the nuanced character of pastels. Sculptors may gravitate to the excited sparks of molten metals or the deep mud grunge of clay, but the appetite for some particular material, and a way of working that material, can be an indispensable ingredient in our art.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve selected two media, collage and encaustics, that are likely to be the muse that can get an artist hooked on getting her daily fix of &#8220;the medium is the message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the art materials and techniques you love to work with can be used for realistic or abstract imagery and everything in between. There&#8217;s something magical about a medium that transforms the art-making process into a true passion for the artist.</p>
<p>Given that there are already so many good books on collage and encaustics that go into depth explaining the materials, processes and techniques involved in the creative use of these mediums, I selected a few projects that highlight abstraction as the end result.</p>

I&#8217;ve been a flea market addict since I was a kid, and I&#8217;ve always been intrigued by the prospect of finding something there that I didn&#8217;t even know I was looking for.</p>
<p>Collage and three-dimensional assemblage works offer an endless variety of possible abstract pictures that use the funky stuff you find on your treasure hunts. Collages are easy to make, inexpensive and, most importantly, offer a thoroughly enjoyable process!</p>
<p>This is not a traditional collage technique but one that adds risk-taking as an active component to the process. This project was inspired by art games made up by Dada/Surrealist groups that sought to take away artistic control of the process so the resulting composition was purely accidental and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Removing your ability to control the outcome of your composition can be unnerving and liberating at the same time. This unorthodox process is similar to exercises like painting blindfolded or doing line contour studies when you&#8217;re not looking at your paper. When you can&#8217;t see what you&#8217;re making, you can&#8217;t expect the resulting image to match your expectations, and you always get something surprising.</p>
<p>There are many ways to go about making a random collage, which range from having the result be completely up to chance to having at least one stage of a composition be determined by a roll of the dice. You can use the following list of potential rules as a guide for deciding how much control you want to have in the collage you make.</p>
<ul>
<li>Materials you use must be found on the street by chance.</li>
<li>Materials you use must come from other people&#8217;s trash.</li>
<li>Materials you use must come from a flea market or thrift shop.</li>
<li>Materials you use must come from rubbings made from random surfaces.</li>
<li>Materials you use must come from parts of your own work (e.g., scraps you&#8217;ve kept in a To Be Continued portfolio).</li>
<li>Some or all materials must come from trading your scraps with someone else.</li>
<li>Materials you use must come from random stuff put in a bag by someone else. You have to pick things out without looking inside the bag.</li>

Artist Lissa Rankin is the author of one of the finest books on working with encaustics that I&#8217;ve read because of the number of ways it inspires you to work in the medium. Her book, <em>Encaustic Art: The Complete Guide to Creating Fine Art With Wax</em>, covers all the bases that make you want to get to work with encaustics as soon as possible! (You can see Lissa&#8217;s work in chapter four.)</p>
<p>I have enjoyed working with encaustics because of the lush feel they have and the depth and luster of color you can get with the wax-impregnated oil colors. Just the fact that you use built-up glazes of wax and color does not necessarily lead to an abstract outcome. As a matter of fact, realist painters and artists of all persuasions use this technique for any type of subject matter.</p>
<p>Try encaustics because the process facilitates working spontaneously, applying layers as you go to see forms, textures and colors appearing organically without having to think about what the outcome will be.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that you can scrape away previous layers of wax and paint to reveal substrata you want to keep as well as to add selective layers in isolated parts of the painting, which is much harder to do with nonwax media.</p>
<p>The painting of mine shown here is an example of layers of transparent wax in between layers of oil paint built up on a base of 1&#8260;8” (3mm) steel plate. I use the steel plate because it&#8217;s more resilient than combustible grounds and it resists warping in the heating process. Even though it&#8217;s cumbersome and heavy, the rock-hard surface of steel also draws me to this combination of mediums.</p>
<p>The layering techniques I used are thoroughly described in Ms. Rankin&#8217;s book, starting in chapter four, with variations in subsequent chapters, and I highly recommend looking into encaustic techniques.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a series is a group of works in any medium with one or more common factors to hold them together&#8212;some kind of theme that can be as specific as your own self-portrait or studying one still life from many different angles, to a series that is as broad as impressions of your dreams or exploring one medium or technique through a sequence of different subjects.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any one theme is necessarily better than another. The most important factor is how deeply it connects to your artistic needs. One of the best reasons to embark on a series is to get yourself out of a rut.</p>
<p>Working on a series doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean making artworks that look alike. To the contrary, works that are part of a series can be vastly different from one another and still make sense together. Starting in 1996, I began a series of one thousand drawings to do in a year as a kind of marathon to push myself to create as many different images in different ways to stimulate my own creativity. This project is an ongoing endeavor and is always there to prod me into new possibilities for making art.</p>

<p>One of the most important goals I have in writing this book goes beyond that of encouraging you to make abstract art. My hope is to have you see the multitude of ways you can engage and cultivate your own innate creativity as part of your daily bread&#8212;your nonreligious spiritual self&#8212;to make your life a richer experience overall.</p>
<p>Do this without being deterred by the naysayers who insist that making art, in whatever form, is just a novelty sideshow, a hobby that in the real world won&#8217;t earn you a living however much you enjoy it.</p>
<p>And please ignore the snobbery of those art experts and critics who, under false pretenses, claim to have the final word on what real ART is, tossing aside any creative form of making (particularly crafts, the non-art, poor cousin of high creativity) that they perceive to be unworthy of praise or encouragement.</p>
<p>Bowing to any of these cynical attempts to define what art is jeopardizes your potential to fulfill the most important mission for all those who desire to make as a way to substantiate who you are: You are, first, last and foremost, an artist!</p>
<p>And if you still think you need an official permit to practice a more daring art, <em>I hereby ordain and decree such certificate of expressive impunity thereby liberating and absolving your artistic personality from the scourges of innovative constipation.</em></p>

<h2 id="EXERCISE-39-Bad-Art-Can-Be-Good"><a href="#EXERCISE-39-Bad-Art-Can-Be-Good" class="headerlink" title="EXERCISE 39: Bad Art Can Be Good!"></a>EXERCISE 39: Bad Art Can Be Good!</h2><p>Of course all of us want to make &#8220;good art,&#8221; whatever that means to each individual, but it&#8217;s exactly that noble, make-nice goal that keeps many artists from exploring new untested territory, and once again, we are protecting our comfort zone against unwanted strangers lurking in the shadows.</p>
<p>This project is a kind of shock therapy for those of you who are set in your ways of working. And if you have your own tenacious innerchild who doesn&#8217;t like being out of that safe zone for too long, this project can be the reverse-psychology medicine to get her to snap out of it.</p>
<p>To make this project work, you need to think like a good football coach who has to run through all kinds of what-if scenarios to come up with a game plan that includes what happens if things go wrong.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what you need to do:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>First you need to pick out at least three pieces of your own recent artworks that you feel were successful and really look at them to think about why they work for you. Some of those reasons may be that they have a balanced composition, one or all three may have a strong color palette, you like the narrative one or more reflects, they&#8217;re the best of a series you&#8217;ve been working on, and so on. (You can also do this project by simply starting a new composition with the full intention of making good art. And even if that doesn&#8217;t completely meet your criteria for a good artwork, make a second piece that&#8217;s the worst possible result for this composition, in effect trying to sabotage the work by using all the bad choices you can think of.)</li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve decided what makes these pieces so good, your task is to pick at least one of them that&#8217;s the best of the lot and make another composition that is the evil twin, bad-art version of this wonderful artwork. In other words, if it has good colors, mix colors that you hate; if you liked the composition, throw it off balance; or if you thought it had a strong narrative, obscure any evidence of that idea.<br>The point of this exercise is to see that some of your attempts to make something good into something bad have the opposite result: The bad piece can be a new good idea! The trick here, however, is that you&#8217;ve got to tune out the bad-can-be-good objective and just move ahead without thinking too much about that question while you&#8217;re in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you can do just one of these good/bad pieces to test the theory here, and I recommend you try this strategy with at least three pairs of compositions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to not choose too many different qualities to change in one piece. If you&#8217;re making a bad painting or drawing, for example, it may be enough to just change the nice colors to ones you hate to make the point. Photographers may want to subvert the way they process a photograph in the darkroom or on the computer to see what the difference is. And sculptors can create a similar form using materials that they normally would stay clear of. But this is another one of those projects that you can&#8217;t know if it has some positive effect on your work unless you try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>When this process works, it reveals that all your efforts to defeat your best artistic instincts&#8212;using the worst colors, making awful compositions and having no regard for common sense in art-making&#8212;are actually liberating forces that demonstrate new pathways to make art that were not considered before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m purposely not including any examples or material list for this project to avoid a debate about what&#8217;s good or bad about choices other artists make. And I fully acknowledge the fact that beauty or good are in the eye of the beholder. So go ahead and make good and bad art as best you can!</p>

<p>OK, I confess, I have an alter ego named Unique Fredrique and I&#8217;m glad I do! My Unique personality comes from my insatiable drive to create without being bound by the conventional norms of what is acceptable picture making for a serious painter. Of course, anytime you start thinking about what your audience might say about your work, you&#8217;re already in trouble.</p>
<p>But with an alter ego who doesn&#8217;t care about such things as good taste in art or being true to the style of art you&#8217;re known for, you can do anything you want and blame it on that shadow figure known only by the name you give him.</p>
<p>The idea that you make up a quirky character who masquerades as your other self is not necessarily for everyone, particularly if this whole notion strikes you as farcical nonsense.</p>
<p>I chose to make up this character because my own sense of humor&#8212;something I hold dear to the nature of who I am&#8212;is usually restrained from joining the process when I&#8217;m making serious abstract art in my studio. And when you restrain something as exuberant as your sense of humor, it can take away some of the joy you feel when making art. So on those occasions when I&#8217;ve built up frustration over not letting the child in me participate in the process, Unique Fredrique comes to the rescue and lets me just have fun for a change!</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on what materials you use for your own alter ego, nor are there any step-by-step processes to show you how to go about creating that art.</p>
<p>The examples you see here of Unique&#8217;s work are provided to get you thinking about what you might want to do. &#8220;Oh, the places you&#8217;ll go!&#8221; But please don&#8217;t feel obligated to make something that looks like one of his art pieces. He has a big enough ego as it is!</p>
<p>So my own Mini Me is not at all interested in good art, aesthetics, art history or any other conventions or proprieties of the art world, including making anything that qualifies as abstract art. As a matter of fact, he is a steadfast nonconformist who paints, draws and sculpts however he wants to by depicting his own ideas that define his twisted personality.</p>
<p>Did I mention that he has no scruples about appropriating unsigned art made by others&#8212;particularly art made by overseas art farm factories&#8212;that he finds at yard sales, flea markets and thrift shops, adding his own ingenious touches to complete a new work of art never intended by the original maker. (See <em>The Real Cause of Forest Fires</em>.)</p>
<p>The fact is I do enjoy having fun with social satire, comic-book parodies and all that is deemed inappropriate in our conservative culture today, and I don&#8217;t think that engaging an alter ego to create art using battleships, tanks and Barbie dolls is a deception about who I am as an artist. Rather, adopting an alter ego personality extends the breadth of who I am as an artist so that I know there are no boundaries to enjoying the process of making art if you just let go!</p>

<p>Of course, most everything I&#8217;ve suggested so far in this book can act as a surrogate alter ego simply by trying something new you haven&#8217;t practiced before. The goal of this book is to give you options for maneuvering around those particularly pesky mental obstacles that get in your way when you&#8217;re trying to make art. Giving yourself permission to be slightly outrageous and unconventional in your art from time to time may be the right chicken soup for your own art-block head cold when you need it.</p>
<p>If you decide to invent a pretend character like this, you might want to decide how public his antics are going to be. It&#8217;s perfectly fine to just keep all this to yourself and the privacy of your studio, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed putting U.F. on stage acting as the out-of-control other me. Part of the fun for me is sharing this quirky artist persona with friends and those who get what I&#8217;m up to. By the way, Unique Fredrique has his own shameless commerce store on the popular website Etsy, if you&#8217;d like to see what he&#8217;s doing these days.</p>

<li>You can say that the crude aesthetics and bad taste produced by your alter ego are his responsibility&#8212;you weren&#8217;t even there when it happened.</li>
<li>Like the art of a two-year-old, I consider Unique Fredrique&#8217;s art to be &#8220;priceless.&#8221; This affords me the option to give his art away to those who admire these zany creations. You can assign very low prices to work that&#8217;s not in line with whatever you might ask for your own art. For example, at a recent yard sale of his work, Unique made a sign that read, &#8220;You decide what you want to pay and then take 10% off of that.&#8221; Such a deal!</li>
<li>Your alter ego is immune to criticism about his work since he doesn&#8217;t care about making good art and he has no scruples about offending people.</li>
<li>You are free to just have pure, unadulterated fun, making art like a kid with an unbridled imagination that knows no bounds. The only potential downside I see may be that this boisterous, high-spirited character takes over your art-making altogether, but worse things can happen.<br><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs86v57infj20go0lgq5e.jpg" alt=""> PIPE SMOKING SNOW MEN</li>

Many artists actually were apprentices to artists they learned from, and others were mentors and teachers to students seeking encouragement. There&#8217;s a mutual reward&#8212;artists inspiring artists and back again&#8212;for mentoring students in their formative years that&#8217;s extremely gratifying for all involved.</p>
<p>For me, mentoring students like Angela McGuire, Jason Antaya and James Presnell, all of whom are exceptional artists in their own right, has returned every bit of motivation to make art back to me to renew my passion on my own path as an artist.</p>
<p>I think one of the best things you can do to keep motivated is to form art groups, however small, to look at and talk about each other&#8217;s work. Having an outlet to talk about and consider your work and that of others is one of the main initiatives for the alumni of art schools, where it&#8217;s common practice to do that on a daily basis. A group I know of meets like a book club, takes up art study books like mine and works on individual exercises they choose with partners or individuals doing the same projects and talking about the results. Needless to say, I&#8217;m a big fan of this mutually supportive idea.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the now old-fashioned notion of going to see actual art in a museum or local art gallery, which has been sabotaged by our computer- and iPod-driven culture where you can see any art in any part of the world simply by Googling it. And even though I, too, use Google as a quick reference tool, there&#8217;s no substitute for looking at the real thing to see what another artist created.</p>
<p>Finally, the purpose of seeing art firsthand in a gallery or in a book or on the Internet should be not only to decide if you like or dislike something, but rather to find an artwork that makes you feel like creating art yourself. This is basic art food even if your inspiration is to copy what you see or make something in response to an artwork you don&#8217;t like. If it gets you to make something, it&#8217;s all good!</p>

This is a testimony to the continuing interest in abstract art today as well as the enthusiasm of the artists who wholeheartedly embrace a wide range of possibilities for making abstract art. I&#8217;ve selected a diverse group of artists to showcase examples of their work plus their comments on their approach to abstraction. There are no projects in this chapter, but my hope is that seeing this group of accomplished artists and their artwork will be the best motivation for you to start making your own abstract art.</p>
<p><em>Abstract art&#8212;far from speaking to those things that unite us, to what we all have in common&#8212;is generated precisely from giving the greatest vent to those things that make us individually different and separate from each other. And it is by this very process that it re-energizes our shared culture.</em> &#8212;Kirk Varnedoe, <em>Pictures of Nothing: Abstract Art Since Pollock</em></p>

<h2 id="Eric-Aho"><a href="#Eric-Aho" class="headerlink" title="Eric Aho"></a>Eric Aho</h2><p>The more I attempt to make something real as a painter, the more abstract it becomes. I love this paradox. As each year goes by, I&#8217;m increasingly engaged with the way abstraction and depiction or realism&#8212;or whatever you want to call it&#8212;are actually intimately joined and in constant struggle with each other. It comes down to how the world is perceived. Can I paint a forest without rendering a single tree? Or show the entirety of the forest with just one tree?</p>
<p>I like the idea of negotiating. I feel like I am always negotiating formal considerations and arrangements I can live with. To make these paintings, maybe even to look at them later, requires recapturing or reestablishing a sense of the eye&#8217;s innocence. I look for continuity, like-mindedness, a radical idea, a solution to a situation that would never have occurred to me.</p>
<p>I see my paintings as loosely assembled reconstructions of what I&#8217;ve seen and felt. I&#8217;m looking for the painting that really is a manifestation of the way I see the world when I open my eyes and look out at the hillside or the forest and then close them again to remember and imagine it&#8212;between blinks, so to speak. I&#8217;m looking for a parallel experience&#8212;that kind of truth. I hope these paintings are emblematic expressions of our larger experience in the world.</p>

<h2 id="Gregory-Amenoff"><a href="#Gregory-Amenoff" class="headerlink" title="Gregory Amenoff"></a>Gregory Amenoff</h2><p>Paintings are all just layers of color on a flat surface no matter the style or imagery. Painting is a fictional endeavor and the job of the painter is to make that fiction compelling&#8212;to arrange that colored material in such a manner that it will draw the viewer into a new world with its own terms and conditions. To find forms and confluences of forms that reside between a state of recognition/naming and full abstraction can be exhilarating. The bandwidth in that area is indeed wide and forgiving, but the ultimate test is still the same as it is on the ends of the spectrum we consider here: Does a painting create a compelling fiction that can stand up to the distractions of our time? It&#8217;s a hard question to satisfy.</p>
<p>Whatever we can say about abstraction and representation, we must agree on one thing: Painting is essentially magic and magic is, plain and simple, hard to do.</p>

<h2 id="Sarah-Amos"><a href="#Sarah-Amos" class="headerlink" title="Sarah Amos"></a>Sarah Amos</h2><p>I think printmaking is in its very nature an abstract concept. You are making an image or mark that is secondary to the final image onto a foreign two-dimensional surface that is, when inked and printed, in reverse. I find a natural kinship in the multiple techniques of lithography, etching and collagraphy for their ability to transform my ideas easily, spontaneously and abstractly. I want the freedom to draw an image relatively quickly and have it presented back to me while igniting the inspiration for the next plates. Printmaking for me is the perfect marriage of a liberating technique and my type of organic/architectural abstraction.</p>

(Stains on a sidewalk, spills and patterns of erosion are all examples of inspiration.) For me, creating abstract art employs both observation and intuition, staying mindful of both positive and negative space. It offers me an opportunity to enjoy the process of surrendering control to intuition.</p>

<h2 id="Adria-Arch"><a href="#Adria-Arch" class="headerlink" title="Adria Arch"></a>Adria Arch</h2><p>I enjoy playing with and rearranging colors, lines and shapes to create images that I want to look at. I want my work to be surprising, playful and provocative. Several years ago I looked through some of my son&#8217;s discarded high school notebooks and found pages of tiny geometrical drawings, and I started incorporating these iconic shapes as compositional elements that direct the viewer deep into the heart of my galaxy-like paintings on paper. Some of my paintings are doors, others windows. They are all portals. I continue to use these symbols because they are a joyous and mysterious language that is somehow both deeply personal and universal.</p>

<h2 id="Olivia-Bernard"><a href="#Olivia-Bernard" class="headerlink" title="Olivia Bernard"></a>Olivia Bernard</h2><p>My work starts with an exploration of the physical nature of materials. I am drawn to materials that have a fragile quality to them, a sense that they are in a process of either still becoming something or decomposing. I work largely from my unconscious, making connections between the emerging vocabulary and all that is affecting me in a typical day: personal events, relationships, nature, political and media images, even the weather. While my work often alludes to known objects or aspects of our surrounding world or uses familiar shapes, such as cones, ovoids and spirals, I arrive at these shapes by working from the inside out, rather than thinking of them first and then working from that external image. My overarching trajectory, which continues to clarify, has been a movement toward an energetic presence, a transient, ephemeral state. I work between the boundaries of what is hopeful and beautiful, and what is dangerous, grievous or macabre.</p>

I work very directly and intuitively and respond to both the figure and to natural forms. Our world today is chaotic, and doing sculpture or drawing gives me meaning and focus, it helps connect and place my thoughts. I like to hope that some of my work connotes, on occasion, a sense of playfulness and daring.</p>

Abstraction is therefore the decoder ring, the looking glass, through which my ideas and emotions and memories get reinterpreted by the viewer.</p>

I regard them both as abstract. My first step is to look at the dimensions of the rectangle. When I make my first foray into this rectangular space, my main concerns are what kind of space surrounds that first move, and do those areas inspire me? My following moves riff off the first ones. I pursue a strong abstract imagery, so that in walking away you can see a distinct afterimage. Though marks and shapes may appear spontaneous, crude and even careless, they are fastidiously deliberate. My motto is &#8220;no moderation in art.&#8221; It should always be an overstatement, even if it&#8217;s an overstatement of an understatement.</p>

I&#8217;ve never considered the unpredictable movement of my material as accidental but rather a simple result of the nature of liquids. To me, forcing the inks to exist in tightly designated spaces holds a beauty of something trapped. It taps into the subconscious and denies premeditated image making. Therefore the forms are typically abstract. This type of automatic drawing connects deeply with inner intentions, and it appeals to my sensibilities.</p>

At this point in our human history, scientific discoveries are outpacing ethics discussions; simultaneously we are also becoming a more religious people, and more fundamentalist religious ideologies are flourishing in the world. I am interested in where these two worlds meet and intersect, especially the point where humanity becomes Creator in the evolution of our universe. These prints speak about Creation as a religious act, a scientific act, a metaphysical act. Where do we, as humans, find ourselves on this spectrum of creation?</p>
<p>The hand gestures that underlie many images come from examples of iconic art and are based on sculpture, painting, embroidery, carvings, etc. from different religious cultures throughout history. Photo etchings and photopolymer intaglio plates from the photographs were further handworked and used in conjunction with printing plates made from scientific photographs of cells, sea sediment, fossils, etc. Other photographic images of spiderwebs, fungus, animals, etc. all add to the cacophony of creation, with each component chosen for its symbolic meaning within the culture of its origin.</p>

<h2 id="Peter-Dellert"><a href="#Peter-Dellert" class="headerlink" title="Peter Dellert"></a>Peter Dellert</h2><p>Since I was very young, I have been compelled to find things, collect them and save them. I think I knew then that they had a higher purpose, but it took me until much later in my life to realize I was supposed to make art with them. Certain objects speak to me because of their shape, their patina, the memories or feelings they evoke in me, or simply the idea that &#8220;I could make something with that.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Intimacy</em> has the external shape of a seed or a pod&#8212;a form I have revisited many times. And at its core is a circle, an orifice, layers of things giving many messages. I first saw it as some kind of fetish. When I put the nails in the sides it felt ritualistic. But it is also very personal, very sexual, as some might read it. I would be the last to deny this kind of influence. But I would want it to be a fetish that is both erotic and spiritual, sexual and mental.</p>
<p>Like a potter, I am trying to find the center. Putting two halves together to make a whole. But the challenge is to stay centered, to learn to repeat the process, to make do with what is here, what is found. The obvious beauty in the human form and in nature&#8217;s forms is all around us. So I try to make art using that as my inspiration and my template.</p>

With paint I create whatever I can imagine&#8212;the powerful impact of something pure and raw, a moment of full-body pleasure.

By building the experience I begin to understand what about the moment moved me to paint in the first place.</p>

I think some of that enjoyment comes from when I was a kid and someone told me not to color outside the lines. That being the only rule, it didn&#8217;t take me long to discover that I could do anything I wanted inside my chosen boundary, the circle. Soon after that my drawings became abstract, and in a strange way that boundary freed me up to explore the abstract through my work.</p>

My goal is to make work with power and mystery, work that unfolds and gets more interesting as you spend time with it.</p>

While my body is excited, my mind is quieted. Color, mark and the movement of the paint transport me. Images come and go but are only valuable in what they open up inside me, what experience they elicit, what corner of my consciousness they touch. When things go well I get to a place where there is no separation between knowing and doing. It is clear to me that it is the only way for me to make paintings.</p>
<p>In the process of painting, the marks make and unmake images and create movement and change. They mirror the movement and flux of nature. For me, abstraction is not an art movement, a moment in art history or a style of painting. It is a crucial, integral connector to the vitality of painting. What is extraordinary for me is that as I go out past what I know&#8212;past where I am controlling what I do&#8212;I find coherency and form. Contact with this wordless coherency, the gift of form is a profound homecoming.</p>

I was impelled by a path of black ink on white paper, the brushstroke that became the subject of the work, and beguiled by the character of the brush-made lines and their gradual transition from dark to light. The process became the matrix upon which the artwork was built. There was no intent other than to explore the simple repeated line.</p>

<p>For me, abstraction is the language of an artist as she translates a thought, feeling, experience or even object, and places it externally into the world. There are many levels and degrees of abstraction from subtle to overt. I use it as a tool to help me get at the essence of a truth whether I employ it instinctively or consciously, whether through exaggeration or reduction.</p>
<p>In my series <em>Shape Shifters and Shadow Casters</em>, I am fascinated with the ambiguity of space and perception. While I have drawn inspiration from photos I have taken of cast shadows mostly on flat surfaces, I am intrigued that using the camera aperture and removing the literal context of the image create the illusion of infinite space. Even the shadows themselves are evidence of this diffuse/defined dichotomy. A shadow itself is ephemeral, yet it is cast from something that is tangible and solid. With this in mind, I reinterpret the flat photograph into a depiction of almost infinite space and visual ambiguity. I want to feel the experience of walking through this infinite and ethereal space as I am creating it. I push and pull at the shapes and imagery, removing, reducing, adding and exaggerating.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I encourage my students to experiment with various levels of abstraction, as this will make their art unique to them and genuine, even when interpreting a common experience.</p>

<h2 id="Budge-Hyde"><a href="#Budge-Hyde" class="headerlink" title="Budge Hyde"></a>Budge Hyde</h2><p>My work with abstraction is simply a process of making art that requires an alternate way of thinking and working rather than a more traditional one. I also believe that such works require an observer to feel and see the paintings very differently than what was expected. As an example, I have a strong interest in exploring the theme of moving images, as in film, and transforming them into a series of still image paintings. The title of the series is <em>Cinema Verit&#233;</em>, a French term used as a way to create a new environment for film. The use of geometric stripes in my paintings represents a specific spatial construct with boundaries that hold sequential film-like photo/images in a single repetitive continuum. My abstraction is in the skewing, discontinuity, complications and any organizational device that forces me into a new methodology and use of materials that will create a more original work of art than what I first thought possible.</p>

I always start with a blank copper plate or sheet of paper. There is something about the emptiness of the page or plate that appeals to me. It&#8217;s usually a calling or need to act out a repetitive drawing or process that leads me to start a work. I no longer work from direct observation, though my older work was based in the patterning I observed in the world around me. This has certainly had an influence, but my current work is more intuitive. Delicacy, intricacy and attention to detail serve as foundations of the work. Through meditative processes, subtle colors and luminous materials, I create images that explore pattern, repetition, multiplicity, subtlety, interconnectedness and the present moment.</p>

I bring those techniques to bear; my art springs from my insatiable curiosity, passionate admiration for nature and a hunger for knowledge that presents itself in the form of sacred geometry.</p>
<p>I observe and analyze forms and strip them to their basic geometric shapes. I found that from these basics, a new idea would grow to its own independent and original manifestation. This contemplative process helps me understand the dynamics between the form and the idea, the physical and the spiritual, and the simplicity of form within complexities of nature. I consider each painting a personal journey to explore these endless possibilities.</p>

I see these items both as what they were intended to be&#8212;items to be read, ads to make one buy something, images of specific people, letters to a friend&#8212;but also as abstract elements, bits of pattern, tone, color, line and shape. The motifs I place on that support are added in densely applied chalk and worked to give them a sense of motion. Although I often start with an agenda, I always allow each work to take me on its own path to build its own image. By using dissimilar materials related only through the decisions made in creating each work, I create an image that requires a more holistic style of viewing.</p>

<p>My work focuses on the intersection of art and science and the visual articulation of scientific observations. My woven sculptures interpret scientific data related to astronomy, ecology and meteorology in three-dimensional space. These pieces simultaneously function as works of art, aural embodiments of data (musical compositions) and instruments that illustrate environmental change.</p>
<p>I want to question and expand the boundaries of traditional science data visualization by utilizing artistic processes and everyday materials that provoke a new set of expectations of what visual vocabulary is considered to be in the domain of science and art.</p>

I like contrasts between density and airiness, between spontaneity and deliberateness, between transparency and opacity, between hints of representation and abstraction, between what just occurred and what will happen next.</p>
<p>New forms emerged in response to this interplay between old and new, deliberate and spontaneous, destruction and creation. Working in this larger scale (7’ &#215; 11’ [2m &#215; 3m]), I was completely immersed in the process, surrounded by shapes and marks. Because the edges were beyond what I could physically reach, I felt like I was inside the drawing while making it. The process felt like cave drawing or like graffiti walls, which are both exciting ideas to me.</p>

I build swirling hair-like strokes into formations, pathways and architectural spaces that reference an internal world full of oppositions: structured form versus unraveling form, rawness versus refinement, exposure versus secrecy and openings versus blockades.</p>
<p>Straight and curve continue their visual drama, but the current battle is between the definitive end of the picture frame and some force in the painting that resists a frame or endpoint of any kind.</p>

<h2 id="Robert-Neuman"><a href="#Robert-Neuman" class="headerlink" title="Robert Neuman"></a>Robert Neuman</h2><p>Robert Neuman&#8217;s inspiration drew mainly from his life experiences and travels. He created a striking visual language that transcends language barriers. He explored ideas of the fast-paced culture with broad, gestural brushstrokes and bold colors that reflected the society. Neuman used color as a language, plus strong composition and geometry to challenge the viewer to make sense between positive and negative spaces, chaos versus structure, ultimately, seen through two sides (fragmentations). Neuman elevated his ideas by also incorporating new techniques such as stamping shapes, collage, layering paint and using masking tape to block out shapes. Often, he used everyday household items such as sardine cans, bottle caps and lampshades to create depth and texture within. Neuman&#8217;s paintings have a variety of surfaces, which give the pieces a sense of dimension and movement. Throughout his professional career, Robert Neuman challenged the viewer to look deeper into how abstract art can influence the world in which we live. The <em>Pedazos del Mundo</em> series is one of Neuman&#8217;s most collected series, most likely because it speaks to and can be related to society, whether looking at it during the 1960s or fifty years later. This series was truly groundbreaking for the abstract artist, incorporating ideas and techniques that can still be found in many of his paintings today.</p>

Trace printmaking offers choices in texture, crispness of image and number of layers as well as sophistication and subtlety. I enjoy the control that comes from continued practice, the many happy accidents, but perhaps because I am a very impatient artist, it is the immediacy of the process that is most appealing. I enjoy working in series, making many variations of single ideas and being inspired by every print to make another. I enjoy squeezing many images out of each plate, using ghost images and echoes of leftover ink, even hardened ridges of semidry ink, to make variations of initial images. I continue to work in large format, enjoying the way that the robust surfaces enhance the imagery.</p>
<p>If I had to analyze any attitude about making my work, an honest observation may be that I enjoy exploring more than staying still. I usually do not repeat technical successes but add one more process, change the sequence, discard the guaranteed result in favor of the unexpected. When I look back on my older work, I sometimes am amazed by decisions I made and, even if I am happy with a result, rarely feel the urge to repeat successful formulas.</p>

Pieces can involve tea bags, matchbook strikes, plastic bottle caps, pencils, plastic cutlery, etc.&#8212;items that are generally disregarded and ignored. Ideas are constructed from controlled assignments given to myself, and I create parameters to limit myself to what can be used in each particular series, which pushes me to really concentrate on and rethink the media and how it can best express my ideas. Once these parameters are set up, I do very basic black-and-white sketches as a leaping-off point. From there I intuitively choose colors and materials to flesh out the composition directly on the piece. I have always worked on several projects concurrently because I believe it creates a dialogue between the pieces.</p>

<p>Encaustic turned out to be the perfect medium for my work and my exploration into the medium turned into a book I wrote, <em>Encaustic Art: The Complete Guide to Creating Fine Art With Wax</em>. As a surgeon, I had to be perfect in the operating room. There was no room for error, no tolerance for mess. But in the art studio, hot wax dripping on my clothes and the floor, unpredictable accidents on the painting surface, etched lines gouged into the smooth surface like a knife on skin, and the freedom to be imperfect and spontaneous were exactly what the doctor ordered. I always said that medicine was my hemorrhage, but art was my transfusion. While it&#8217;s possible to paint with encaustic in a methodical, orderly fashion, I prefer to let the molten wax lead me, rather than leading it. Every time you apply heat to the surface, the surface changes. Choosing a medium that encourages such spontaneity, such free-form play and such gleeful mess was precisely what I needed to make art that reflected my inner story, a story of transition, transformation and healing. It&#8217;s kind of like life&#8212;it&#8217;s all more inspired, beautiful and fun if you just surrender to the flow.</p>

I am particularly intrigued with excavating layers of history exposed in a state of decomposition. I create solvent transfer prints from digital images of textures and surfaces produced in natural and human terrains, and construct and tie together the shifting layers of imagery. The images serve as a metaphor for larger conceptual interests emphasizing transition, history, perception and the temporal. I am fascinated with the psychological dissonance found within incongruent and disparate realities, suggesting a fragile world with an ambiguous sense of time and space.</p>

They are an exploratory conversation into the imposed reality of the macroscopic world. A significant metamorphosis occurs when becoming encompassed with this work at an immersive scale. The transformation sometimes departing entirely from its original anatomy, tiny realities inspire me to find that which we overlook in order to venture somewhere unrecognizable, yet intriguingly familiar.</p>
<p>The floral forms become brilliantly grotesque when facing their mortality, yet they are forgotten and left to rot. There is beauty in the field of decay; existence continues after demise.

I strive to cultivate sensitivity to the relationships between given materials, tools and process, and allow compositions to emerge in an exuberant exchange of chance and vernacular. While my personal visual language continues to evolve marks and motifs, I feel the work to be most free and meaningful when it proceeds as an activity without an objective, when I can find a way to lose my way. In &#8220;Eye and Mind,&#8221; the philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty remarked that &#8220;It is by lending his body to the world that the artist changes the world into paintings.&#8221; The artwork for me is an ontological marker of that process of transforming seeing into meaning, and meaning into being. It is the way we make the world.</p>

<h2 id="Nicholas-Wilton"><a href="#Nicholas-Wilton" class="headerlink" title="Nicholas Wilton"></a>Nicholas Wilton</h2><p>Over many years, my paintings have slowly drifted toward abstraction. I became interested in trying to convey the feelings and nuances of nature, and it became important to compose the paintings in a way that allowed them to interpret the work for themselves. It was essential to leave more empty, unresolved areas or rather unrecognizable, abstract areas in my paintings. Abstraction, like poetry, does not dictate a clear narrative but quietly offers a fragment, a piece of a mysteriously familiar narrative. In my paintings there has continued to be a paring down of recognizable natural forms, which now have given way to a personal abstract vocabulary of shapes, colors and forms. The prominent use of abstraction has allowed me to distill and better communicate my emotions and ideas about life, nature and our respective place within it.</p>

<h2 id="Cynthia-Winika"><a href="#Cynthia-Winika" class="headerlink" title="Cynthia Winika"></a>Cynthia Winika</h2><p>Abstraction plays a role in my work as the bones of the intuitive, visual, nonverbal arrangement of elements I choose. I blow up fireworks on the surface of the paper, which leave smoke, burn tracings and deposits of colorful chemistry as the fireworks spin around on the paper. These random marks are a springboard for juxtaposing and arranging my figurative drawings, paintings, transfers and found papers/objects. I adhere with wax medium to fix in place. The paper becomes skin-like and translucent, allowing the imagery to be read from behind and in front. I can also add further layers of imagery or text to make it denser.</p>

<h2 id="Zack-Wirsum"><a href="#Zack-Wirsum" class="headerlink" title="Zack Wirsum"></a>Zack Wirsum</h2><p>I do not want my paintings to be entirely absorbed at initial read; I want viewers to spend time with them and new areas of interest to be continually found. I want the sections that reference the real world to not be immediately apparent, but to emerge upon study. The abstract aspects of my work derive from observation of my urban surroundings.</p>
<p>Essentially this reflects a version of self-portraiture that speaks not to the literal, but the interior, the imagined, creating vignettes of thought process in paint.</p>

<h2 id="Yuriko-Yamaguchi"><a href="#Yuriko-Yamaguchi" class="headerlink" title="Yuriko Yamaguchi"></a>Yuriko Yamaguchi</h2><p>I am always interested in a discovery process in art making rather than working for something I am familiar with. I also want to express internal feelings and thoughts in my work. Something more elusive, poetical and imaginative in my work is my goal. As a result, my work tends to be abstract rather than representational.</p>

<h2 id="Yuan-Zuo"><a href="#Yuan-Zuo" class="headerlink" title="Yuan Zuo"></a>Yuan Zuo</h2><p>The composition of traditional Chinese ink painting has not changed much over the last thousand years. The high horizon line, faraway mountain, clouds, pathway, stream in the valley, elegant pine tree and rocks are classic elements of Chinese art. Traditional Chinese painting never aims to create a three-dimensional illusion of space using Western perspective. Rather, the hierarchy of objects in the picture portrays space, and a sense of movement is shown by the size, darkness and speed of the brushstrokes. The artist expresses his response to nature and his inner spirit through these basic principles.</p>
<p>Though my pictures are abstractions that don&#8217;t resemble conventional Chinese paintings, I still work from observation and present my own honest feelings or ideas through colors and brushstrokes that have become my own tradition as an artist.</p>

<h1 id="About-Dean-Nimmer"><a href="#About-Dean-Nimmer" class="headerlink" title="About Dean Nimmer"></a>About Dean Nimmer</h1><p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs86lu1p7nj20go0dgwfy.jpg" alt=""> Dean Nimmer, Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, has exhibited his work in over two hundred solo and group exhibitions across the United States, Europe, China, Japan and Australia. His work is in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Smith Art Museum, Harvard University; Museum Haus Katsuya, Japan and in the collection of the New York Public Library.</p>
<p>Dean has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Massachusetts Artists Foundation, Mass Cultural Council, Jasper Whiting Foundation and the Kao Foundation in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>He is the 2010 winner of the Distinguished Teaching of Art Award given by the 16,000-member College Art Association and honored with the 2011 Distinguished Alumnus Award in the fields of Art and Art Education by the University of Wisconsin. He is also listed in the current edition of Who&#8217;s Who in American Art. Dean is the author of <em>Art from Intuition</em>, now in it&#8217;s fifth printing.</p>
<p>Dean&#8217;s goal in teaching, is to inspire artists to find the myriad of accessible possibilities for creating original artworks that are inspired by the powers of imagination and an enthusiasm for the process of making art.</p>

<h1 id="Acknowledgments"><a href="#Acknowledgments" class="headerlink" title="Acknowledgments"></a>Acknowledgments</h1><p>First and foremost, I wish to praise the substantial help and support of fellow artist and dear friend, Janet Stupak. Indeed, without Janet&#8217;s help, this book may not have come to fruition. Beyond contributing outstanding examples of her work to the project, Janet worked tirelessly to help me craft the voice of this book that enthusiastically says, &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s art matters!&#8221;</p>
<p>I want to thank artist and teacher, Christopher Willingham, who contributed several projects to this publication that demonstrate unique inroads to using meditation and Zen philosophy for creating abstract compositions. I&#8217;m still pushing for Chris to write a book of his own, focused on the spiritual connections between art making and a higher consciousness.</p>
<p>In addition, I wish to thank Timothy Hawkesworth and Gregory Amenoff, who contributed their insightful perspectives on the history and meaning of abstract art, along with dynamic examples of their own work.</p>
<p>Also high praise for the assistance of my former student, James Presnell, who has developed into an extraordinary artist and valued friend.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Tonia Jenny, for her expertise, patience and support as editor of this publication.</p>
<p>Most important are the over fifty artists whose artworks and statements demonstrate the diversity of opportunities there are for creating abstract art across a wide spectrum of backgrounds and philosophies.</p>
<p>And always, I am grateful for the continuing love and support of my sons, Corey and Christopher, daughter, Lilly and grandchildren, Camden and Kaitlyn Nimmer along with my extended family and networks of friends, students and colleagues.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my highest admiration, love and respect for my longtime friend, fellow artist and teacher, David Prifti, who will be remembered by generations of young artists who carry his inspiration with them.</p>
