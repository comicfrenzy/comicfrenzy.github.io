<h1 id="INTRODUCTION"><a href="#INTRODUCTION" class="headerlink" title="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h1><p>How do you create a human being from nothing? This question is at the forefront of fiction writing, as without a solid character foundation, your book is merely words on a page rather than a fully immersive world. From the protagonists of the story to the background players, each character in your great work of literature must have a fully constructed frame for you to build upon.</p>
<p>Characters that have a strong framework will begin to cast shadows as the plot continues. They become so real that the audience becomes trapped; the suspension of disbelief creates a shell in which the reader is separated from their own reality. As a writer, this is what you want. You want the book to haunt the reader years after they have put it down.</p>
<p>And it all starts with the characters you create.</p>
<p>This guide has one definitive purpose &#8211; to give you food for thought when crafting your characters. There are four sections in total: Background, Mind, Body, and Soul. The background section helps you to create the base framework, the character&#8217;s full back story. The next section is devoted entirely to your character&#8217;s underlining motivations and personality traits. The body segment is to help give visual representation to your character through the power of your writing. The soul section is a compilation of character scenarios that will give you a better sense of how your character might respond to any given situation. Finally, the extra sections are to help you when it comes to characters that may not fit into mainstream fiction writing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the following guides are written in full question format in order to encourage you to come up with an answer without over-thinking. This way, you are actively participating in the creation process even when answering simple questions.</p>
<p>Although, you obviously do not have to complete the whole guide for your character, the more of the guideline you utilize the more the character becomes real to you.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider using the guideline for each character in your novel, not just the main players. The more characters you understand, the more realistic it is when your primary characters interact with them.</p>
<p>I hope this guide gives you a stepping point to polish up your characters!</p>
<p>Happy Writing,</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<h1 id="BACKGROUND"><a href="#BACKGROUND" class="headerlink" title="BACKGROUND"></a>BACKGROUND</h1><p>The character background is by far one of the most easily forgotten aspects of character design, though it has a large effect on how your character interacts with others around them, and how they came to be who they are today. A flat character can, for example, be abandoned on a tropical island the same as a complex one. Canonically, you could have them build a raft, but without understanding their background you have no idea how logical this is for them. Are they coming from the middle of a hot, desert town or are they coming from a small lake village where boating is common place? If it&#8217;s the former, then it simply would not make sense for them to easily construct something that would float from only the materials available on the island.</p>
<p>All that is important background information you need to keep in mind before starting on your prose.</p>
<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>To construct your own character, let&#8217;s start with the basics of their background:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What is your character&#8217;s full name?</li>
<li>And how do you pronounce that?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the meaning of the name?</li>
<li>Do they have a specific nickname, or perhaps an alias, maiden name, etc.?</li>
<li>Where did the nickname (etc.) come from?</li>
<li>Do they have another special nickname by their spouse or close friend?</li>
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>Where did the nickname come from?</li>
<li>How old is the character?</li>
<li>When is their date of birth?</li>
<li>That means their zodiac sign is?</li>
<li>Which makes them how old?</li>
<li>What is their biological gender?</li>
<li>What is their identifiable gender?</li>

<li>What is their potential IQ?</li>
<li>Compared to others, would their intellect be considered average, high, or poor?</li>
<li>What is their date of death?</li>
<li>How old will they be when they die?</li>
<li>What will be their manner of death?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Biographical-Information"><a href="#Biographical-Information" class="headerlink" title="Biographical Information"></a>Biographical Information</h2><p>Your character&#8217;s upbringing is paramount to how they would react to certain situations as an adult, or even as a young child. Let&#8217;s work on creating a background that will give you more insight, shall we?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do they have biological, adoptive, or other type of parental units?</li>
<li>Are they alive?</li>
<li>When did they die?</li>
<li>Where do they live now?</li>
<li>What are their names and ages?</li>
<li>How many siblings do they have?</li>
<li>What are their names and ages?</li>
<li>Compared to their siblings, what place are they? E.g. middle child, youngest, only child, etc.</li>
<li>Any nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, or other family members of note?</li>
<li>What are their names and ages?</li>
<li>Are there any known ancestors?</li>
<li>Does the family have specific enemies?</li>
<li>What about allies?</li>
<li>Does your character still live with any family member?</li>
<li>What is your character&#8217;s place of birth?</li>
<li>Do they have a family symbol? E.g. crest, shield, etc.</li>
<li>What is their ethnic background?</li>
<li>Where do they live now?</li>

<li>Do they have any children?</li>
<li>What are their names?</li>
<li>Does your character have any grandchildren?</li>
<li>What are their names?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="THE-MIND"><a href="#THE-MIND" class="headerlink" title="THE MIND"></a>THE MIND</h1><p>A mind is a terrible thing to waste, as the saying goes. For your character &#8211; the last thing you should do is give them a fairly decent background, but then fail to give them any kind of personality. Remember, a Mary Sue or Gary Sue (male and female characters that are considered &#8216;perfect&#8217;) often become such because the writer creates a cardboard brain. You want a character that is personable, and while they may certainly be flawed, they should still have complex aspects that don&#8217;t shift towards either scale of black or white. Think about your own day-to-day life. Is your daily choices based entirely on the traditional notion of &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;evil&#8217; or are you simply making second-to-second choices based on the all of the information available to you. The best villains, despite their characterization as evil, really believe that they are engaging in the best course of action.</p>
<p>Keep this in mind as you move through this section.</p>
<h2 id="Personality-Traits"><a href="#Personality-Traits" class="headerlink" title="Personality Traits"></a>Personality Traits</h2><p>Your character will have many personality traits. At times, they may be angry or sad; sometimes they may be downright depressed. The surge of emotions that changes based on any given circumstances is what makes us human. However, each individual may be more resilient or more prone to anger. It&#8217;s up to you to discover these nuances.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="Guiding-Motivations"><a href="#Guiding-Motivations" class="headerlink" title="Guiding Motivations"></a>Guiding Motivations</h2><p>Now we are in the thick of it. The nitty gritty of why your character does what they do. I am not just referring to the main plot arc your character falls into, but what guides them for every action they take: from the people they fall for to the things they fight for. Let&#8217;s figure it out together.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In a social group, are they submissive or dominate?</li>
<li>Were they ever bullied or teased when they were younger?</li>
<li>By whom?</li>
<li>Are they bullied or teased now?</li>
<li>By whom?</li>
<li>Does your character get along well with their parents or guardians?</li>
<li>What are the issues?</li>
<li>What about their siblings?</li>
<li>What are the issues?</li>
<li>Does your character have a lot of friends?</li>
<li>Do they have a lot of romantic partners?</li>
<li>Did they ever suffer a bad breakup?</li>
<li>Who did it involve?</li>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>Do they have any jealous lovers?</li>
<li>Does their family have a reputation outside of the home?</li>
<li>What is the religion of the family?</li>
<li>Is their religion important for the family?</li>
<li>What is your character&#8217;s religion?</li>
<li>How important is religion for your character?</li>
<li>Does your character have a specific moral code that is unique and outside of religion? I.e. a personal code of ethics.</li>
<li>What is the family&#8217;s political affiliation?</li>
<li>Is politics important for your character&#8217;s family?</li>
<li>What is your character&#8217;s political affiliation?</li>
<li>Is politics important for your character?</li>
<li>What is your character&#8217;s main reputation among their family?</li>
<li>Among their friends?</li>

<li>Compared to the common social hierarchy, what is their social status?</li>
<li>Was your character active in the community when they were younger?</li>
<li>What did they do?</li>
<li>Are they active now?</li>
<li>What do they do?</li>

<li>No mental health concerns?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="THE-BODY"><a href="#THE-BODY" class="headerlink" title="THE BODY"></a>THE BODY</h1><p>It&#8217;s easy to simply chalk your character up to: male standing 6ft 2, with black hair and brown eyes. However, there are billions of people in the world that would fit this exact description. Simply saying that your character has black hair does not indicate if it&#8217;s thinning, if it&#8217;s long, short, brittle, curly, etc. You picture the character clearly in your head, but you need to ensure that your audience does too. Vague descriptors will only give your audience a general sense of what your character may look like. At times, this can be enough. However, giving yourself a full and concise written description can make it easier to draw back to as you move through your novel. Moreover, you can also use it as a reference if you decide to get art of your character made or you need to give your cover designer something to work with if you are self-publishing.</p>
<h2 id="Primary-Visuals"><a href="#Primary-Visuals" class="headerlink" title="Primary Visuals"></a>Primary Visuals</h2><p>Let&#8217;s start by outlining the main graphic elements, the first thing that the audience will visualize when they are first introduced to the character.</p>

<li>Do they have a small, medium, or large frame?</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="Physical-Attributes"><a href="#Physical-Attributes" class="headerlink" title="Physical Attributes"></a>Physical Attributes</h2><p>Now that we have the main body fleshed out, it&#8217;s time to get more technical. Although, many of these characteristics may not make it into the final prose, these descriptions will help polish off some of the rough edges that are often left behind.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Does your character look much younger or older than they are biologically?</li>
<li>Are they considered traditionally attractive?</li>
<li>In what way?</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="Personality-amp-Style"><a href="#Personality-amp-Style" class="headerlink" title="Personality &amp; Style"></a>Personality &amp; Style</h2><p>Characters in TV shows and movies can often be identifiable based off their clothing alone. Superman dons his red and blue suit while Jason Voorhees puts on his creepy hockey mask. What about the things that they like? Such as the pets that they have or the book they are most likely to pick up? As writers, clothing and personal style choices aren&#8217;t always necessary to include, and thus, many of us don&#8217;t bother with visualizing this aspect of the character at all. However, we need to keep these selections in mind because it reveals a great deal about personality.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What kind of style of clothing does your character wear?</li>
<li>Where do these clothes usually come from? E.g. from a high end store, the character makes them, the character is donated them, etc.</li>
<li>Does your character dress themselves?</li>
<li>Why not?</li>
<li>Compared to society at large, is their clothing selection considered fashionable?</li>

<li>Bottoms?</li>

<li>What kind?</li>
<li>Does the character wear makeup?</li>

<h1 id="THE-SOUL"><a href="#THE-SOUL" class="headerlink" title="THE SOUL"></a>THE SOUL</h1><p>You now have a believable character to work with. Before, or as, you write your novel it is good practice to place your character in a variety of different situations, even outside the scope of your genre. Doing so will allow you to understand how your character will react to any given situation. The more you understand what their reactions and actions might be the better your story will flow as you begin to place your character into the actual plot of the novel.</p>

<h1 id="NON-TRADITIONAL-CHARACTERS"><a href="#NON-TRADITIONAL-CHARACTERS" class="headerlink" title="NON-TRADITIONAL CHARACTERS"></a>NON-TRADITIONAL CHARACTERS</h1><p>Traditionally, many fiction characters are heterosexual adult males and females. However, diversity itself should be lauded and as such, it is important to consider when that mold is broken. What if you decide to write for teens or young children? What if your character decides to forgo all constructs of gender for something more androgynous? Or, perhaps your character is an animal or an alien? Further still, what if your character hits on all three types? First and foremost, it is important to continue to consider the humanity in these characters; even if they are not human. A great example of this is when an interviewer once told George R.R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, &#8220;I noticed that you write women really well and really different. Where does that come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which Martin replied, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve always considered women to be people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this vein, this section was added to help those who write non-traditional characters and want a fuller springboard to work with. However, it is important that one does not consider the addition of these sections as a crutch. These characters should be fully fleshed out and more often than not, treating these characters as you would the stereotypical, traditional characters makes them far more authentic than simply treating them as an &#8220;other&#8221;. With that in mind, use these questions to build richer backstories, personalities, and appearances rather than concentrating on that perceived otherness.</p>
<h2 id="Young-Characters"><a href="#Young-Characters" class="headerlink" title="Young Characters"></a>Young Characters</h2><p>Young characters can be especially hard to write because, more often than not, our adult minds have already experienced a vast amount of situations that most kids haven&#8217;t even dreamed of. Even the most mundane tasks, such as paying taxes or the aches and pain that comes with aging, are beyond the scope of a child&#8217;s mind. As such, characterization, especially for young characters, can completely make or break a plotline. Whether your young characters are in the background or front and center, each character must be believable, which means you need to understand how a child thinks and acts.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Does your character act much older than they are biologically?</li>
<li>What about younger?</li>
<li>Are they considered a &#8220;cute&#8221; kid or traditionally attractive if they are a teenager?</li>
<li>In what way?</li>
<li>Are they considered traditionally ugly, whether as a child or teen?</li>
<li>In what way?</li>
<li>Does your character feel like they need to eschew the role that has been mapped out for them? I.e. Their parents or guardians want them to be a knight, but they would rather be a baker.</li>
<li>What do they want to be when they grow up?</li>
<li>Will there be a lot in the way of achieving that goal? I.e. The character comes from a poor background, but one day they want to be very wealthy.</li>
<li>Are they more concerned with responsibilities or having fun?</li>
<li>When taking on responsibilities, whether minor or major, are they prone to complaining or are they proud to achieve certain goals?</li>
<li>Do they have responsibilities that most children their age do not?</li>
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>Who placed this responsibility on them?</li>
<li>Do they have any animosity towards that person or group?</li>
<li>Do they have to take care of someone other than themselves? E.g. the family pet, young brothers and sisters, etc.</li>
<li>When having fun, do they enjoy spending most of their free time alone or with a group?</li>
<li>If with a group, who do they spend most of their time with?</li>
<li>If alone, what do they enjoy doing?</li>
<li>Are they treated strangely because of it?</li>
<li>Does your character have a best friend?</li>
<li>Who is it?</li>
<li>Does your character have a crush?</li>
<li>Who is it?</li>
<li>Would they ever act on this crush? I.e. ask someone they like out.</li>
<li>Does your character have a world view they have built for themselves or based around what they have been taught?</li>
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>If this view is based on what they have been taught, who taught them?</li>
<li>If it is based on something they have gathered themselves, how did they come about it?</li>
<li>On that note, is your character aware of the darkness of the world? E.g. they know that everything must die, they know that bad things sometimes happen to good people, etc.</li>
<li>If so, do they feel like there is something they can do to change the world or do they feel that they will just have to accept life as it is?</li>
<li>If they feel like they can one day change the world, are they taking an active role now or are they waiting until adulthood?</li>
<li>In what ways have they accepted the negativity of the world?</li>
<li>What does the character think about themselves? E.g. their appearance, their personality, etc.</li>
<li>Are they actively trying to change certain aspects of themselves?</li>
<li>If so, is this because of a negative aspect they have found or based on what others have told them?</li>
<li>If it is the latter, who pointed out this flaw?</li>
<li>Does your character keep any kind of traditional memento for a child that age? E.g. yearbook, journal, diary, photo albums, etc.</li>
<li>What might be contained within its pages? E.g. the journal might have their day-to-day activities, their yearbook may only have signatures from close friends, etc.</li>
<li>Do they keep anything else from their childhood? E.g. collecting ticket stubs, Valentine cards, etc.</li>
<li>Have they ever tried to run away?</li>
<li>If so, was it for adventure, desire to rebel, or because of a bad home life?</li>
<li>If the home life was bad, who caused the negativity?</li>
<li>Does your character feel like they have a lot of input into their day-to-day life or is everything decided for them?</li>
<li>Do they rebel often?</li>
<li>What they normally do when rebelling against authority?</li>
<li>Whose authority do they typically rebel against? E.g. their parents or guardians, the law, the highest fraction of the land, etc.</li>
<li>Do they find it hard to rebel or very, very easy? I.e. they always second guess themselves thinking they will &#8220;get in trouble.&#8221;</li>
<li>On that note, is the character a traditional goody-two-shoes or a &#8220;bad kid?&#8221;</li>
<li>As an infant, did your character cry often?</li>
<li>As an infant, did they complete &#8220;firsts&#8221; faster than their peers? E.g. stood on their own first, talked in full sentences by three, etc.</li>
<li>As an infant, was your character held often or coddled in anyway?</li>
<li>By who?</li>
<li>In the toddler stage, were they considered bratty?</li>
<li>In what way?</li>
<li>In childhood, were they prone to getting &#8220;sick&#8221; in order to avoid certain school activities? I.e. telling their parent they are too sick to go to school in order to avoid picture day.</li>
<li>Do they have trouble paying attention in class or are they more likely to get the concepts before the other children?</li>
<li>Are they highly communicative, able to voice their needs or concerns, or they keep everything bottled up inside?</li>
<li>Would they be considered a teacher&#8217;s pet?</li>
<li>What about a class clown?</li>
<li>At what age did they first realize their body was changing?</li>
<li>Was this a particularly awkward time for them?</li>
<li>In what way?</li>
<li>On graduation day would they be more likely to be the Valedictorian or be last in their class?</li>
<li>If they would be a Valedictorian, what would their speech be?</li>
<li>Would you say your character will change significantly as they get older, or will they be true to the same personality they had when they were younger?</li>
<li>Does your character have friends and comrades that will be there for their rest of their life? (Death and other obstacles notwithstanding).</li>
<li>What about family members?</li>
<li>What kind of obstacles does your character currently face?</li>
<li>How are they handling them?</li>
<li>Do they have a strong support system to help overcome these problems?</li>
<li>Who is within that support system?</li>
<li>Do they enjoy having this support system or do they feel like they must handle their own problems?</li>
<li>Do they often feel they must take on life&#8217;s challenges by themselves?</li>
<li>Does your character have a specific destiny that will affect them at a certain age? E.g. they are the chosen one, they will become king, etc.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the age?</li>
<li><p>What is the destiny?<br>Now for some scenarios geared specifically towards young characters:</p>

<h2 id="LGBT-Characters"><a href="#LGBT-Characters" class="headerlink" title="LGBT+ Characters"></a>LGBT+ Characters</h2><p>As many would agree, the spectrum of sexuality is an extremely complex one. In fact, the term LGBT, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender is often in itself sometimes seen as exclusive of certain sexuality types. For this purpose, one might find the term LGBTQ (lesbian, gay bisexual, transgender, and queer) to be more appropriate as well as the LGBTQIA acronym (which adds &#8220;intersex&#8221; and &#8220;asexual) to be formidable. No matter what acronym one uses it is important to keep in mind, once again, that these characters should not be written in a way that dictates otherness. To illustrate the point, one might run into the same wall when the individual is a male writing a female character, an able bodied character writing a disabled character, or when writing a character in an entirely different race. The point is not to create a stereotype or build a character that seems overtly sexualized or written as a joke, but rather one should use these questions as a platform to fully understand who these characters are as a person. No matter how they view themselves.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What sexual orientation does your character identify as? E.g. gay, bisexual, pansexual, etc.</li>
<li>What sexual orientation are they perceived by others? I.e. the character is gay, but everyone believes they are heterosexual.</li>
<li>Is this by choice?</li>
<li>If not how is that choice been hindered?</li>
<li>If this is because of a person, who is that person?</li>
<li>If they choose to identify outside of the realm of sexuality, such as being androgynous, in what way do they make this known? E.g. informing others, choosing to wear both male and female clothes, etc.</li>
<li>Are they more effeminate, masculine, or a little bit of both?</li>
<li>In what ways do they express this?</li>
<li>At what age did they realize they were not traditionally heterosexual?</li>
<li>How did they cope with this knowledge?</li>
<li>Did they tell anyone?</li>
<li>If so, how did that person(s) react?</li>
<li>Aside from their reaction, did your character find a lot of support with disclosing their sexual orientation?</li>
<li>If support was granted, in what way?</li>
<li>If no support was found, how did your character cope?</li>
<li>Has your character been intimate with members of their preferred gender?</li>
<li>At what age was their first encounter?</li>
<li>In terms of awkward versus very sensual and exciting, how was that experience for them?</li>
<li>Did this initial relationship last?</li>

<li>If positive, why have these relationships ended?</li>
<li>If largely negative, what has been the biggest barrier?</li>
<li>What has been the longest lasting relationship?</li>
<li>Why did this particular relationship end?</li>
<li>Does your character have a strong support system currently?</li>
<li>If so, who is included?</li>
<li>Does your character use any kind of coping mechanisms against any bigotry they find? E.g. they attend LGBT+ meetings, they drink or take drugs, etc.</li>
<li>Are these coping mechanisms healthy or harmful?</li>
<li>Do any members of their support system know of these coping mechanisms?</li>
<li>Has your character been exposed to any type of prejudices?</li>
<li>What were the incidents?</li>

<li>Was a member(s) of authority called? E.g. law enforcement, school principal, parents, etc.</li>
<li>Did the other party get arrested or did those in authority turn a blind eye?</li>
<li>How did your character handle these situations?</li>

<h2 id="Nonhuman-Characters"><a href="#Nonhuman-Characters" class="headerlink" title="Nonhuman Characters"></a>Nonhuman Characters</h2><p>For many writers, nonhuman characters are some of the most difficult to write, whether aliens or animals. This is often because, like with young characters, we are only seeing the world with our adult human mind. The world for these creatures is extremely nuanced and complex. For example, suppose your animal character only communicates through the use of pheromones? What if your extreme human, such as a fairy or a vampire, hasn&#8217;t been amongst humans for thousands of years? In all of these cases you must find a way to draw out the uniqueness of the species while still allowing the reader to relate in some way. The best way to do that is to use these questions in order to fully understand the biological and social needs of your species, while still allowing that extremely important human connection.</p>

<li>How does your character use them to their fullest?</li>
<li>Your character has decided that it wants to become human. The only way to do this is to turn its back on its family and live amongst man. How does your character break it to their tribe?</li>

<li>A group of nefarious humans have rounded up your character and a number of its species. Soon your character finds themselves trapped inside a large dome with others of its kind.

<li>After coming across several impressionable humans your character soon convinces them that they are a type of deity. The rouse works better than expected and they can&#8217;t seem to shake these new human followers. How do they cope with the humans&#8217; unshakeable interest?</li>

<li>In a similar scenario imagine that your character&#8217;s human family spends all of their time with this member and ignores your character. How does your character react to the lack of interest or engagement?</li>
<li>Sadly, your character&#8217;s human family can no longer afford the upkeep it requires for your character. How does your character react when they realize they&#8217;re on their way to the local shelter?</li>
<li>Would that reaction be different if your character&#8217;s human family could take care of them but simply did not want them anymore?</li>
<li>Your character has decided to volunteer at a local animal shelter, only it isn&#8217;t for the good of the facility. Instead they plan to liberate all animals inside. How do they go about accomplishing this subversive task?</li>
<li>After committing a negative act against the humans your character is charged and sentenced to community service. What might this be?</li>
<li>Your character is found by a group of baying hound dogs. Their hunter masters are not too far behind. How does your character manage to get away?</li>
<li>After a heavy night of revelry your character wakes to find themselves inside a large cage. How might they have gotten here?</li>
<li>How might your character escape?</li>
<li>Your character tries human food for the very first time and finds out its highly addictive. They can&#8217;t stop eating the stuff! The problem is that they eat so much food that they are in danger of being run out of town. How does your character manage to get their fix anyway?</li>
<li>Imagine a similar scenario in which your character tries human alcohol for the very first time. However instead of making them especially inebriated it makes them very powerful instead. How do they best use this strange gift?</li>
<li>Your character gets into a tussle with a predator far more menacing than they. The fight is clearly in this predators favor based on brawn alone, but how does your character use is brains?</li>
<li>Your character is riding in (or driving) a vehicle for the very first time. The odd movements, the way the road passes by, and the closeness of the other drivers are all a strange experience for your character. Do they end up liking this new method of travel or will they vow never to set foot in a car again?</li>
<li>For centuries humans have enslaved your character&#8217;s kind. Now your character has had enough and is going to lead a rebellion in a revolt. What action do they take first?</li>
<li>Suppose the revolt did not end well and countless soldiers, on both sides, are now gone. How does your character cope with the losses that they are the cause of?</li>
<li>Your character has been walking for miles in the middle of a dessert, finally coming across a shimmering lake of cool water…only it&#8217;s a mirage. Does your character catch wind of this fabrication or do they go as far as try to drink the water that isn&#8217;t there?</li>
<li>Several centuries after the apocalypse has hit, your character comes across an abandoned human dwelling. The last existence of man is so long ago that your character has no idea what these bipedal creatures are. What kind of impressions does your character paint based off the ruins they find?</li>
<li>Your character and its people are sitting down with humans after a truce has been called. Many are calling it the &#8220;Second Thanksgiving&#8221; because a large meal is planned. What kind of foods does your character bring to the table?</li>
<li>Sadly your character comes across the body of one of its own kind. It&#8217;s very clear that the hapless victim died tragically. Your character has a suspect in mind. Do they choose to take revenge or wait before jumping the gun?</li>
<li>Suppose your character blames a nearby human only to find out later that it was another member of their species. How does your character deal with their mistake?</li>
<li>In order to become the next ruler of the clan your character must fight another member to the death. The only problem is this opponent is their best friend since childhood. Does your character complete the ancient ritual anyway?</li>
<li>Your character and a human happen across each other for the very first time. Quickly a method of communication is established. What does your character say?</li>
<li>After a terrible curse your character is turned into a human. What is the first thing they do after the change takes place?</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the end of an era and your character is the last of its kind. How might they cope with the inevitable extinction of the species?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h1><p>After, answering all of those questions, I hope that you have a better understanding of your character. Remember, it is good practice to answer the questions for each of characters, not just the protagonist. Don&#8217;t feel obligated to answer every question, but once you feel you have a solid idea of who your character is as a person, answer yourself this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I have a complete view of what my character looks like, from their head down to their toes?</li>
<li>Do I understand how my character might respond to any given situation, and what their reasoning would be for doing so?<br>If your answer is no to either one of those questions, then perhaps you can go back and complete more of the guide. However, if you answer with a resounding yes, then congratulations! You now have a fully solidified character that is real enough to cast shadows. You are now halfway towards creating your book.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, best of luck to you and I hope to be able to read it someday!</p>
