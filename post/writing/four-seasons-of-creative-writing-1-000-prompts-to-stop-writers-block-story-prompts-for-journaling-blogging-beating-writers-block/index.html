<p>Alicia, 5-star Amazon review</p>
<p>&#8220;While they&#8217;re certainly helpful for writing, I have used the prompts for creative inspiration for other things as well - art projects, business solutions, etc. I’ve bought quite a few of these type of books over the years and this was definitely one of the best!&#8221;</p>

<h4 id="Foreword"><a href="#Foreword" class="headerlink" title="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h4><p>In August 2010, I compiled two years worth of material into a book called 1,000 Creative Writing Prompts: Ideas for Blogs, Scripts, Stories and More. The material took the form of writing prompts, story starters that can help writers of all ages to turn an idea into a story. I’d written those prompts every now and then while I was working various jobs at offices, coffee shops and eventually, my freelance writing career. Surprisingly, the book of prompts, which was more of a last ditch effort to get me out of debt than an attempt anything substantial, began to take off.</p>
<p>Four years later, I’ve decided to start writing prompts more often on a variety of subjects. I have the opinion that every aspect of our lives can be mined for creativity. This book and the other ones that I plan to follow it with will help you to start digging.</p>
<p>No matter where you are in the “trying to be a writer” process, I hope that this book helps you to take the next step. Happy writing.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>I really hope you enjoyed this book and that it gave you inspiration for years to come. As you may know, this isn&#8217;t my first writing prompts rodeo. This book is part of a five-book series that includes four other 1,000 writing prompt collections. The books are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/000-Creative-Writing-Prompts-Scripts-ebook/dp/B0044DEL7C/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,000 Creative Writing Prompts, Volume 1</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/000-Character-Writing-Prompts-Villains-ebook/dp/B007BIFYNC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,000 Character Writing Prompts</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/000-Creative-Writing-Prompts-Holidays-ebook/dp/B008TYZ7X4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,000 Creative Writing Prompts for Holidays</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/000-Creative-Writing-Prompts-Scripts-ebook/dp/B00GHXYASM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,000 Creative Writing Prompts, Volume 2</a></p>
<p>The books are all $2.99 each. Since buying four books can add up and you may be a starving artist, I&#8217;ve put together a box set so you can save 25% off the individual books and get the collection for just $8.99! Check it out.</p>
