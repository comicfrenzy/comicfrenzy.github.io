<p>Darrell Pitt &#8211; What Does it Take to be a Successful Author?</p>
<p>A Few Final Words</p>
<p>Welcome to Secrets of Successful Writers!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting time to be a writer.</p>
<p>We now live in an era where writers can both create and publish their own work and make a living out of doing what they love.</p>
<p>Contained within Secrets of Successful Writers are interviews I conducted with fifty authors. They talk about their writing, how they became published authors and how they market themselves in this brave new era of ebooks. These interviews came about as a result of a series of interviews I conducted on my website <a href="http://www.darrellpitt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.darrellpitt.com</a></p>
<p>Some of the writers contained within are traditional writers, having built their careers by seeking an agent and a publisher before finally seeing their books in print in the bookshops. Others are building successful careers as self-published ebook authors. One of the most famous of these is John Locke, the first self published ebook author to sell a million copies of his novels.</p>
<p>And he did it in only five months.</p>
<p>They are all writers. None of them will tell you it&#8217;s an easy path (what worthwhile things in life are easy), but within this book they offer tips and techniques on what has worked for them &#8211; and what has not.</p>
<p>I believe this book will save you both time and money. I&#8217;m sure it will most certainly give you a clearer indication of how to set your sail and adjust your rudder to achieve your writing goals.</p>
<p>It has been said that there are as many different types of writers as there are writers. That is certainly true of the writers contained within this book. There is Micaela Wendell who was thirteen when she wrote the first draft of her book The Branding. There is Dolores Durando who wrote and published her first book when she turned ninety.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Ninety.</p>
<p>You will find authors who write detective stories, westerns, romance, thrillers and children&#8217;s books. Some of them are writing genre fiction in areas you would not have thought possible.</p>
<p>There are writers who have written one novel. There is the amazing Robert J Randisi who has written over five hundred of them (amazing, but true).</p>
<p>As a writer myself, I have certainly experienced the pain of trying to build a writing career. I have written stories that I have had repeatedly rejected. I have had crushing, soul destroying critiques that have emotionally flattened me.</p>
<p>Still, I have picked myself up, dusted myself off and continued forward, reminding myself that this is what writers face all the time. It can be a tough business, but all businesses are tough in their own ways.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information contained within Secrets of Successful Writers. I urge you to read it, re-read it and talk to your writer friends about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes a piece of advice you skimmed over will suddenly jump out at you when you look at it again six months later. I am serious about this. Suddenly the importance of a single line will make a synapse fire in your brain and you will shake your head and wonder why you didn&#8217;t realise its importance in the first place.</p>
<p>Most of all, it&#8217;s important to realise you are not alone in your writing endeavours. Other writers have faced the same difficulties you are facing. Others have walked the same path. If you follow their trail you may find it takes you to your destination.</p>
<p>In the meantime, keep writing.</p>
<p>Darrell Pitt.</p>
<p>Robert J Randisi &#8211; Author of 500 Novels. Believe it or Not!</p>
<p>Robert J Randisi has been called many things. He has been described as &#8220;the last of the great pulp writers&#8221;, he has been called &#8220;a living legend&#8221; and he has been called “the world’s biggest private eye nut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever words you use to describe him, it would be accurate to call him prolific. To date he has written, and published, over five hundred novels.</p>
<p>Whassat?</p>
<p>Yes, strange, but true. While most writers struggle to write that one book they&#8217;ve always wanted to write, this amazing writer has written over five hundred novels during his incredible career.</p>
<p>Born in Brooklyn, New York, he made his first sale at age twenty-two. He co-founded and edited Mystery Scene magazine and co-founded the American Crime Writers League. He also founded The Private Eye Writers of America in 1981 and created the Shamus Award.</p>
<p>Robert has written in many different genres, but most of his books have been westerns and crime stories.  His adult westerns are now being distributed from Speaking Volumes LLC. They will be distributing 200 of the books from his Gunsmith series as well as all of his Angel Eyes, Tracker and Mountain Jack Pike novels. His books will be available as both POD trade paperbacks and in audio form.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing (and do you have a word limit per day)?</p>
<p>Robert - No word limit. I used to have a page limit of 20 a day, but that was when I was working on one book at a time. Depending on my deadline, I’ll do anywhere from 10 to 40 pages a day on a book. As for a schedule, I usually wake up at 11 am, have breakfast, start writing until dinner (5, 6) then nap for two hours and write all night until 4 am or so. Then I read until 5 am and go to bed. The nap usually bridges the gap from one book to another when I’m working on two at one time.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you plot a story out completely first or do you let it lead you in certain directions if the need arises?</p>
<p>Robert - I have never plotted a book from start to finish, and I’ve written and published over 500 of them. There is too much that can happen to change that, so why waste time? I usually follow the plot along with the main character, experiencing what he experiences.</p>
<p>Darrell - It’s easy to imagine that mystery books will still be around for years to come, but do you think Western novels still have a long life ahead of them?</p>
<p>Robert - I do. Our history is always there, it doesn’t go away. There is a dedicated western readership in this country. Sometimes they have to carry the banner alone, sometimes they get some help. But they’ll always be there.</p>
<p>Darrell - There’s often a debate about ‘literary’ books as opposed to ‘popular’ novels. Why do you think this is?</p>
<p>Robert - What’s the debate? Which to read? Which to write? It doesn’t make much difference to most readers. A book is a book. As far as writers are concerned literary books get you notice but no money, popular books get you money but no notice. The word “literary” pretty much means you’re going to read a book where nothing happens.</p>
<p>Darrell - If you had a single piece of advice to hand to someone trying to become an author, what would it be?</p>
<p>Robert - Write every day, as many hours as you can. Don’t worry about page count. You’ll have to worry about that soon enough, when you start writing to a deadline.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you see the future for writers now that ebooks have arrived?</p>
<p>Robert - I’m not a big fan of e-books. I like the way real books feel and smell, too much. But a book is a book, and you’ll always need a writer to produce them. E-books are threatening to publishers and book stores, but not to writers.</p>

<p>Heather Killough-Walden &#8211; A Passionate Story Hits Amazon&#8217;s Number One</p>
<p>Heather Killough-Walden is the author of some nine novels including &#8220;The Spell&#8221; which recently reached number one on the bestselling romance novels on Amazon. In this interview I asked Heather about how she became a writer, her thoughts on writing stand alone novels as opposed to writing a series of books and what she believes are the best ways a writer can promote themselves.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you want to become a writer in the first place?</p>
<p>Heather - I suppose the writing itself is what made me become a writer. I learned to read at what is considered a very young age, and the ability to write came clinging to its coat tails. I&#8217;ve never been good at spoken communication; I get nervous, fumble over my speech, and suffer from horrible foot-in-mouth disease. As a result, I realized early on that if I wanted to communicate effectively, I would need time to think before I spoke. What gives you more time to think about what you&#8217;re going to say than writing it down? By the time you&#8217;ve put your thoughts into words, they&#8217;re more or less edited. It&#8217;s the safer bet.</p>
<p>But because I was quiet and preferred time to myself, I wasn&#8217;t the most popular girl in school. Hence, I used my writing as a bridge between this world and one that wasn&#8217;t quite so painful. This other world was of my design. I drew its landscape, colored its people, gave it depth and dimension. It was filled with beings who were larger than life and indomitable because that was what I wanted to be. They could defend themselves, stick up for others, and even defy gravity to literally leave their troubles on the ground.</p>
<p>I almost flunked out of high school because of this other world. Instead of paying attention in pre-calculus, I sat scrunched in my desk and furiously scribbled stories about vampire and werewolf gangs clashing on a deserted, bon-fire lit beach. I suppose that in the end, those stories did have more to do with my career choice than did exponential functions and logarithms.</p>
<p>Darrell - What’s a typical day of writing like for you?</p>
<p>Heather - I wake up to writing and I fall asleep to writing. There is a quote by Eugene Ionesco that I keep on the front page of my website: &#8220;A writer never has a vacation. For a writer, life consists of either writing or thinking about writing.&#8221; That couldn&#8217;t be more true. The moment I wake up, I use mouthwash. Then, while my daughter is still asleep and before hitting breakfast or even a cup of coffee, I am at my computer, responding to personal feedback from readers.</p>
<p>My daughter normally wakes up somewhere in the middle of this and I rush to fix her breakfast, give her a bath, get her dressed, and prepare her for homeschooling. As she does her assignments, I sit across from her with my laptop to get back to work on any one of the seven novels I am currently writing and on the administrative work that comes with keeping up some kind of presence in the literary world. I hit the FaceBook messages, blogs, sales copy, cover copy, synopses, edits, more edits, and so forth with all I&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, I do the laundry, vacuum, take out the trash, clean the bathrooms, and make phone calls for doctor&#8217;s appointments, hair appointments, and dental appointments. All the while, however, I&#8217;m noticing people and places and music and movement and cataloguing everything around me for use in my books. Sometimes I&#8217;m doing the cataloguing in a literal sense &#8211; writing notes in a small leather-bound notebook I carry with me everywhere I go.</p>
<p>Family is important (obviously), so I try my best to make time with them every night. We sit together for an hour and read from the Kindle or a paperback; Terry Pratchett, Wendy Mass, Frances Hardinge and the Monk series by Lee Goldberg are some of our favorites. But I&#8217;ll be honest with you&#8230;a lot of the time, as we&#8217;re reading, my thoughts are drifting to my own stories. I have always (and most likely always will) existed half in this world and half in that other. It is both an escape and an inescapable prison, perhaps gold gilded, but a prison nonetheless, and as soon as both my husband and my child are back in bed, I&#8217;m once more seated before the computer, my fingers flying across the keyboard. If not there, then I&#8217;m tucked into the couch with throws all around me like a nest, a leather journal in my lap, the quiet night air filled with the sound of my pen scratching and the next door neighbor&#8217;s dog barking at god only knows what.</p>
<p>At some point, I fall asleep. But even in my dreams, I&#8217;m writing. Almost the entirety of The Game came to me in a dream, as did the lead characters in The Patrick Sinclaire Story, The Third Kiss, and Sam I Am, along with the plot for Hell Bent.</p>
<p>And then, four or five hours later, I wake up and do it all again.</p>
<p>Darrell - You have a number of series for sale as well as a number of stand alone novels. Would you recommend a new writer start trying to produce a series?</p>
<p>Heather - I recommend that a new writer write what he or she knows and what he or she is comfortable writing. If that&#8217;s a stand-alone novel, then fantastic. If it&#8217;s the first novel in a series, then also fantastic &#8211; but be prepared. If the book sells well, it means you actually have to write the next books in the series. There&#8217;s no going back.</p>
<p>Writers have to stick with what they know and what they are passionate about. Whether this turns out to be a paranormal romance series or a single thriller, if it is filled with passion and knowledge, it will be wonderful and people will read it.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think are the best ways for a writer to promote themselves?</p>
<p>Heather - Be nice to your readers. That&#8217;s the number one rule. They&#8217;re priceless; you aren&#8217;t a writer without someone to read your words, and it&#8217;s your readers who purchase your books, spread the news about you through word of mouth, and continue to come back for more.</p>
<p>Create a stark, eye-catching cover that draws readers to your book out of all of the books surrounding it on the Amazon or Barnes and Noble page. A book is always judged first by its cover, no matter how the saying goes. This is essential. Also, pricing is very important for eBooks. EBook readers don&#8217;t want to pay the same price for an eBook that they would have to pay for a physically tangible object such as a paperback. So, price accordingly or they&#8217;ll walk away.</p>
<p>On the second tier of importance in the marketing arena are of course all of the tools most indie authors already know how to use: Twitter, FaceBook, guest blogs, etc. Remaining active on these fronts is fairly important. Plus, it can be fun. It&#8217;s a gift to be able to interact with your readers, to feel their excitement over something you&#8217;ve created. The fact that you&#8217;ve touched someone&#8217;s life with your words &#8211; well, that&#8217;s immeasurably cool. It&#8217;s why we write professionally, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>JR Rain &#8211; Writing Good Books is the Best Marketing Tool</p>
<p>JR rain has had amazing success with his writing. He has written numerous books with many of them ending up on the Amazon Bestseller list. He is the author of the Vampire For Hire series, The Jim Knighthorse series and The Spinoza series just to name a few. Today he speaks to us about the process of writing and how he connects with readers.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>JR - I generally write throughout the day, often wrapping things up around 7:00 p.m., but I have also been known to write well into the night. One of the reasons I moved up to a little island in the northwest was to spend the majority of my time writing in solitude. For the most part, I&#8217;ve been able to do that. My day usually starts at 6:30. I make coffee, feed the dog, read and meditate…and then start writing at 8:00 a.m. I love getting an early start to the day. I will then write until about 7:00 p.m., taking time during the day to walk my dog, go to Starbucks, eat and nap. I&#8217;m in bed by midnight every night.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve had some ups and downs in your personal life over the years. Do you think the good and the bad times have contributed to your success as a writer?</p>
<p>JR - I certainly appreciate the good times because I&#8217;ve known the bad times. I think most writers have known the bad times. For me, I call those the &#8220;bleak years&#8221;. I think struggling through the down times helps create focus. Personally, I prefer the good times. ;)</p>
<p>Darrell - Other members of your family are also writers. In what way have they influenced you as a writer?</p>
<p>JR - My mother encouraged me at a young age. She had so much confidence in me. God bless mothers. Also at a young age, I watched with interest my father&#8217;s early forays into writing. I was just enthralled to witness the whole writing/selling/publishing process. My father, sadly, never broke into major print, but his efforts left an indelible mark on me. My mother had success writing non-fiction, especially articles for magazines. She was also a journalist for a small newspaper. Just watching the two most important people in my life making an effort to write and publish was really all I needed to see. I was bitten by the writing bug at a young age and I&#8217;ve never looked back.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve had several bestselling books on Kindle. A lot of them are priced at $2.99. To what degree do you attribute pricing to your success?</p>
<p>JR - Early on, when I first started on Kindle in 2009, I actually priced my books at $9.99. I believed in my books and felt they were worth the price. I would go on to play with pricing for the next 6 months before I settled on $3.99, which I think is a fair price. But in general I charge $3.99 for novels, and $2.99 for short story collections and novellas. I would suggest play with the prices until you find your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think are the best ways to market yourself in this modern era as a writer?</p>
<p>JR - Good question. There&#8217;s no easy answer to this and things are changing so rapidly that it&#8217;s all some people can do to keep up. In general, though, you always want a web page and Facebook page. I also have a Myspace page and Twitter account. Having an email list for monthly newsletters helps, too, but you want to make sure this list only includes readers who have voluntarily opted in. Otherwise you&#8217;re going to irritate a lot of people. Having a running blog helps, too, although I no longer have one. (Why not? I decided I would rather spend my time writing books than blogs…One running blog, updated weekly for a year, is about one completed novel.) Anyway, those are the basics.</p>
<p>Now, your goal as a writer is to get your books in front of as many people as possible. So that&#8217;s your challenge: how to find the greatest amount of readers? I would even suggest take it a step further: how to easily find the greatest amount of readers? There&#8217;s no right or wrong way to do this. There are hundreds of ideas to do this, but I would suggest finding ways that take the least amount of time and yet still generate the greatest possible results. You don&#8217;t want to spend all your time marketing, and in the end, a good book goes a long way to selling itself.</p>
<p>Darrell - If you had one piece of advice to give to someone trying to make it as a writer, what would it be?</p>
<p>JR - Write what you know. Your home town is more interesting than you might think. Unless you really are an ex-CIA operative, writing about what you know makes your books unique and stand out. Many of my characters are insurance claims investigators or private eyes (both jobs I&#8217;ve had). Almost all my books are set in cities I&#8217;ve lived in. And almost all my characters have my own traits and quirks, good or bad. For instance, Jim Knighthorse suffers from severe color blindness. So do I.</p>

<p>John Locke &#8211; One of Amazon&#8217;s Most Successful Ebook Authors</p>
<p>John Locke has quickly become a legend in the ebook self publishing industry. He was the first independent author to sell one million ebooks on Amazon. When this interview was conducted, he was working on the seventh book in his Donovan Creed series, Vegas Moon, as well as his second Emmett Love western, Don&#8217;t Poke the Bear. John lives in Kentucky, USA.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your biography on Amazon says that, “Every 7 seconds, 24 hours a day, a John Locke novel is downloaded somewhere in the world.” That’s pretty impressive. How did you become a writer and how did you become so amazingly successful?</p>
<p>John - I always thought it would be a great achievement to write a complete novel. Whether it made money or not. I never acted on that idea because I was too busy with my work. But a few years ago I found myself with some free time and some stories to tell, and thought it would be fun to give it a shot. Just write, all the way to the end, without quitting. My first manuscript was titled, &#8220;Killing Hailey.&#8221; It was absolutely dreadful. Seriously bad. No one needed to tell me that. When it&#8217;s bad, it&#8217;s bad. So I set it aside and thought about it a few weeks, and came to the conclusion there were some great characters in that book. All they needed was a better author. So I started over, with the characters, and let them tell the story.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your covers are a little reminiscent of the old Carter Brown books. Is he one of your influences?</p>
<p>John - I was not familiar with the Carter Brown books before you posed the question. I checked out some of the covers and am not sure I see the similarity. However, his covers are certainly unique. I think if your covers are unique, they become a symbol for your work. Last year my publisher, Claudia Jackson, of Telemachus Press, came up with the idea of using women&#8217;s legs for my covers. I loved it. It was a great branding idea.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your kindle books are priced at only 99 cents. Has this been a successful strategy for you?</p>
<p>John - Yes and no. Yes, because it was a great way to draw attention to my books. No, because if I had started at $2.99 and lowered my prices I&#8217;d be a hero, while now, if I raise my price from 99 cents to $2.99, I&#8217;m a goat.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you see the future of ebook publishing as opposed to print publishing?</p>
<p>John - I think print books will become an experience, and ebooks a staple. Going to a bookstore, browsing the books, is an experience. There&#8217;s something special about it. You don&#8217;t have to buy your books that way anymore, but it&#8217;s fun. The movie business is similar. You can rent or buy the movies you want to see, but the actual movie experience is different. It&#8217;s more expensive, but there&#8217;s something special about seeing a movie when it first comes out, in the format it was intended to be presented.</p>
<p>Darrell - Follow the Stone was a sideways step into the world of the western. It seems to have been just as successful as your other books. What made you write a western?</p>
<p>John - I love the idea of westerns. It&#8217;s a simple dynamic: a man or woman overcoming hardship to carve out a meaningful life in a savage land, while maintaining their integrity.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you give to someone about to publish their first novel as an ebook?</p>
<p>John - The minute you send it out into the world, start writing the next one. Don&#8217;t worry if your first one is going to sell, because it probably won&#8217;t. And if it does, your public is going to want the next book anyway, and you&#8217;ll have nothing in the tank to give them. Your readers want to know you&#8217;re committed to providing them with content. In this regard, writing is like a friendship. Do you want to be my friend? Then BE there for me!</p>

<p>Michael Prescott &#8211; Four Bestselling Ebooks on Amazon Kindle At Once</p>
<p>Most authors would be over the moon if they had one bestselling book on Amazon Kindle Bestseller List. Michael Prescott has had four. Here is a sample of recent rankings:</p>
<p>Shiver - #23 in Paid Kindle, #16 in Literature &amp; Fiction, #3 in Suspense</p>
<p>Mortal Pursuit - #29 in Paid Kindle, #2 in Action &amp; Adventure, #2 in Police Procedurals</p>
<p>Stealing Faces - #38 in Paid Kindle, #27 in Literature &amp; Fiction, #6 in Suspense</p>
<p>Riptide - #95 in Paid Kindle, #3 in Psychological Thrillers, #4 in Police Procedurals</p>
<p>This is obviously pretty amazing. In this interview, Michael speaks to us about his writing and the best ways other writers can market themselves to get their books into the bestseller lists too.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Michael - In my thirty or so years as a professional writer I’ve tried various approaches. When I was writing horror novels in the 1980s, I forced myself to do four double-spaced pages a day. Usually I wrote at a specific time and treated it like a job. I had to work fast because I wasn’t being paid much! Later I became more relaxed in my approach and gave up on the idea of a daily schedule or a targeted number of pages. However, I always had a sense of the deadline and how many pages I needed to complete each month.</p>
<p>Everything changed a few years ago when the mass-market paperback end of the business started falling apart. Like many midlist writers, I was shown the door. I thought I could find a new home at another publishing house, but with the industry in transition there were no takers. At that point I switched my focus and started making money in ways unrelated to publishing. However, I still wanted to self-publish a thriller called Riptide, which I’d shopped around unsuccessfully to print publishers. It was basically a vanity project. I was mainly interested in bringing it out as a print-on-demand edition, using CreateSpace. Doing it as an ebook was an afterthought. I figured as long as I had the book proofread and formatted, I might as well put it out as a Kindle edition too.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the print on-demand version has sold relatively few copies, while the Kindle edition is doing much better. Eventually I decided to do ebook versions of some of my out-of-print titles, since the rights had reverted to me. When the ebooks starting to sell, I realized – somewhat to my surprise – that this was actually a viable market.</p>
<p>Now I’m doing some original writing for the first time in a while. But it’s different from my earlier stuff. What I’m working on is a short comedy novel specifically for the ebook market. There’s no deadline, so I write when the spirit moves me.</p>
<p>I guess the short answer is, there’s no typical day of writing for me. Sometimes I get inspired and write a whole lot of pages, and other days I focus on other things. And this was true even for much of the time when writing was my only job.</p>
<p>Darrell - You started out writing a number of scripts for movies, but switched to novels. Do you think of yourself as a ‘visual’ writer?</p>
<p>Michael - To be honest, I probably wasn’t visual enough to be a good screenwriter! Only one of my scripts actually got made into a movie, and it was awful.</p>
<p>The main difference between screenwriting and novel-writing is that in a screenplay everything has to be condensed. Plot developments and character motivations have to be reduced to a few lines of dialogue or a little bit of action or a single meaningful image. In a novel, on the other hand, you can explain things at length. You can get inside the character’s head and show exactly what he’s thinking and feeling. For me, it’s much easier and comes much more naturally.</p>
<p>I don’t think my style of writing is particularly visual. I think it’s more oriented toward dialogue and interior monologue. In fact, sometimes the first draft of one of my scenes consists only of dialogue. I fill in the action and descriptive details later.</p>
<p>Darrell - You mentioned on your website that you had problems getting your book “Final Sins” published. How did this come about?</p>
<p>Michael - It was actually Riptide, not Final Sins. Final Sins was the last book I did for a print publisher, and it concluded a loose trilogy that began with Dangerous Games and Mortal Faults. All three books featured a pair of heroines, Abby Sinclair and Tess McCallum, who had an interesting dynamic. But because mass-market paperbacks were on the decline, sales for each book were lower than for the previous one. After I finished Final Sins, I couldn’t find anyone to publish either Riptide or another book I wrote on spec, which I’ll bring out as an ebook eventually. Nobody was buying fiction unless they thought it was going to be another Da Vinci Code.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think The Da Vinci Code ended up doing more harm than good to the book industry. It’s an entertaining book, but its success was, to some extent, a fluke. It’s not the kind of thing you can repeat at will. Even Dan Brown couldn’t repeat it. And yet publishers became obsessed with finding the “next” Da Vinci Code. In the process, they lost sight of the less splashy books that had been making money for years. They weren’t interested in “small” stories anymore. Everything had to be high-concept, over-the-top, international in scope. But not every writer can do that kind of thing, and not every reader wants to read it. So they ended up losing a lot of perfectly good writers and alienating a lot of formerly dependable readers, all in the quest for another mega-hit.</p>
<p>Darrell - You currently have four books in the Kindle top 100 “paid” bestsellers. How did you achieve this amazing feat?</p>
<p>Michael - I’m not entirely sure! But the basic strategy is one I learned from a good friend of mine, J. Carson Black, who used it to get several of her books into the top 100. And I think both of us are indebted to Joe Konrath, whose blog about ebooks has provided a lot of inspiration and solid, practical advice.</p>
<p>For me the strategy has two key points: First, price your book at $.99. There’s a whole subculture of ebook readers who look for these bargain books. Second, promote your book using Amazon’s discussion boards, which can be accessed toward the bottom of any Kindle book’s sales page. Include a link to your sales page in any comment you post. Visit, say, five boards at a time and post your sales pitch. Do this only on boards that specifically request sales pitches and book recommendations. Don’t do more than about five at a time, because some people subscribe to multiple threads and get irritated reading the same ad over and over. Wait a few days or a week, then visit five new boards and repeat the procedure. Keep track of which boards you visited so you don’t place duplicate ads on the same thread. It doesn’t take much self-promotion to start getting some sales. As the book moves up in the rankings, sales may snowball.</p>
<p>I’ve also made my books available in Nook editions, but those aren’t selling well. Barnes &amp; Noble does not have the same resources available for indie authors to make themselves known.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way for writers to market themselves?</p>
<p>Michael - The best way is to use the Amazon discussion boards, as mentioned above. But it’s also good to have your own Facebook page – not just a personal page, but an author page devoted exclusively to publicizing your books. You should also have your own website with links to your sales pages. If you have a mailing list of readers, send them a note when you put out a new title. Many people use Twitter, but I don’t. I’m too damn old to tweet.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you feel about self publishing for writers? Do you think this is where the future lies?</p>
<p>Michael - I think the days of the big publishing houses, which take 90% of the book’s earnings and allow the author a royalty of 10% or less, are coming to an end. I’m not saying they will all go out of business, but I think they’ll be less important in the future. As it becomes increasingly clear that authors can find a large audience through ebooks and keep 35% or 70% of the income, while writing only the books they want to write, it will be tough for the big houses to stay competitive. Even now, they’re pricing their ebooks too high and taking too long to bring out digital editions. They don’t seem able to adapt nimbly to changing conditions, and I think this is going to be a fatal flaw for some of them.</p>
<p>I’m sure big bestselling authors will continue to have nationally distributed print editions of their books, and there will also be a market for children’s books, graphic novels, art books, and other books that are given as gifts or intended for collection or display. It’s not the end of print, but it is the end of print’s monopoly, and that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Richard Zimler &#8211; The Power of Myth</p>
<p>Richard Zimler was born and bred in New York. After a successful career in journalism he turned to teaching and then writing. He has now written some seven novels over the last twelve years. His novels have appeared on bestseller lists in 12 different countries and he has won a swag of awards over the years. His latest book is The Warsaw Anagrams, a mystery written about a series of murders that take place within the Warsaw ghetto.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Richard - I usually wake up around 7 a.m. and eat breakfast with my partner. My partner leaves for work around 8 o&#8217;clock. Once I&#8217;m alone, I go upstairs to my work area and begin working. I start a page or two before I left off the day before, so that I can work myself back into the rhythm and structure of the book, and &#8211; above all &#8211; get back inside the head of my narrator. I try to always focus on both the quality of my sentences &#8211; their rhythm, in particular &#8211; and on moving the story forward. And I re-write constantly. If something isn&#8217;t working, I keep at it for as long as I have to until I get it just the way I want it. If I need to do more research while I&#8217;m writing &#8211; to add an historical detail, for instance &#8211; then I consult the books in my library or do a search on the Internet. I stop for lunch around noon and usually make myself a sandwich. While I&#8217;m eating, I watch a bit of television &#8211; maybe an NBA basketball game or an episode of CSI. Then I go outside and walk around my neighborhood. We live near the sea in the city of Porto &#8211; Portugal&#8217;s second city &#8211; so I often walk along the ocean. We have a kind of boardwalk in Porto, with cafes and restaurants. On a sunny day, with the ocean sparkling, it&#8217;s gorgeous. When I get back home, I make myself a cup of tea and go back to work. I usually quit around 5 or 6 p.m. When I was younger, I could go on longer, but now that I&#8217;m fifty-five years old, I don&#8217;t have the stamina. After about six or seven hours of writing, I&#8217;m done for the day. I&#8217;ve come to realize that pushing myself too hard only hurts the quality of my writing.</p>
<p>Darrell - You worked as a journalist and taught journalism prior to establishing your writing career. How has your journalistic writing helped or hampered your fiction writing?</p>
<p>Richard - I think it has mostly helped me. First, because writing articles trained me well in the mechanics of writing: in the need to pay attention to every word and to work toward a good rhythm in my sentences, for instance. Second, it got me used to sitting down and writing for a few hours every day. Third, it helped me see the value in finding the telling detail: the tone of someone&#8217;s voice, for instance. Fourth, it made me more observant and more aware of the importance of getting everything right in my descriptions of people, places and events.</p>
<p>On the other hand, training in journalism can also have negative effects. First, because reporters tend to write very quickly and, largely because of that, to become easily satisfied with mediocrity. I&#8217;m not blaming them, because there is usually so little time for developing a story, but it is an occupational hazard. That hasn&#8217;t been a problem for me, because I love working on the poetry in my prose, but I see it in other novelists &#8211; in those, for instance, who feel that they have to write a certain number of words per day. That seems to me a very negative concern. It&#8217;s more important to write five great sentences per day than five mediocre pages.</p>
<p>Also, journalists tend to think that there are hard and fast rules about how one should write. They become very limited in their approach to structure and rhythm. And they can easily lose sight of the poetry of language. They tend to become very judgmental about anyone who writes in a different style or who has a different approach &#8211; as if they are doing something wrong.</p>
<p>One journalist I would highly recommend is Ryszard Kapu&#347;ci&#324;ski. He is by far the best reporter I&#8217;ve ever read. He is observant and intelligent, and he brings an astounding wealth of knowledge and experience to his articles and essays. He is a wonderfully sensitive writer, and he shows an enormous solidarity with the people he writes about. I would recommend that potential writers start with The Shadow of the Sun. It brings together all his writings about Africa. It is a brilliant book.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the future for hard copy books as opposed to ebooks?</p>
<p>Richard - I think that readers who are under 25 years old have a different relationship with technology than readers like me, who are older. They grew up with sophisticated personal computers, cell phones and computer games. So they like being able to store 50 books on a small device and carrying it with them wherever they go. They like having access to email everywhere they go. They don&#8217;t see it as odd. And they probably don&#8217;t mind reading a 400-page novel on a screen. In general, for someone my age &#8211; fifty-five &#8211; that would be nearly impossible. After about twenty pages, my eyes get tired and I long to have a hard-copy book in my hands. I like the feel of a book. I like to see their covers. I like to browse in bookshops and search through the stacks in the library without knowing what I&#8217;m after. So I think that for at least the next 20 years or so, until my generation of readers is in its 70s, physical books will still dominate. After that, ebooks will probably take over, at least in the developed world &#8211; in Western Europe and America &#8211; where high-tech devices are easy to purchase and affordable to the middle class. What all this will mean for countries that are less developed, or ones that are developing quickly &#8211; like India and Brazil &#8211; I haven&#8217;t a clue. Perhaps all this will lead to a more egalitarian world, in terms of access to books and other forms of cultural transmission. That would be wonderful. But if the gap between the rich and poor remains huge, unequal access to books and information may remain a big problem and may only be exacerbated by the advent of ebooks.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, &#8220;The Warsaw Anagrams&#8221; is currently #8 on the Kindle bestseller list at Amazon.co.uk, so it seems as if the advent of ebooks is helping my novels find new readers! I&#8217;m grateful for that, of course.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>Richard - I have two possible answers. If what you mean by &#8220;success&#8221; is the possibility of selling a lot of books, then I would suggest to any aspiring writer that he or she only write a novel after first becoming famous. Celebrity almost always guarantees success in terms of sales, because famous people who write books get a great deal of publicity. In Portugal, for instance, the novelists whose books sell the most originally became famous as newscasters and television personalities. Unfortunately, their novels are abominably written, and they have virtually no talent. In addition, their novels are usually &#8220;clones&#8221; &#8211; re-worked versions of books that were successful in America or Great Britain, such as the bestselling novels of Dan Brown. But they get coverage in all the newspapers and magazines and sell extremely well.</p>
<p>If becoming famous seems unlikely, then the next best bet for an aspiring writer who wants a lot of worldly success would be to write superficial books about trendy topics &#8211; novels that don&#8217;t require readers to have much experience of the world. Also, it would be best to write for a target audience of readers between 15 and 30 years old.</p>
<p>If, however, you measure success in terms of the quality of the book, then I have a different answer. In that case, novelists who want to write great books they should read all sorts of books, and both fiction and non-fiction. They should read great storytellers like Doestoevski, Faulkner, Henry Miller, Philip Roth, Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. They should read works from many different countries, since there are widely varying styles and traditions of storytelling. They should sample a bit of everything: historical novels, science fiction, love stories&#8230; They should read anything and everything that is well written. And they should read poetry. That way, they will develop their sensibilities and they will come to see that there are the infinite possibilities for their own writing. They will feel invigorated by the great books, as well. And they will come to feel part of a community of writers all over the world.</p>
<p>They should also write every day. They shouldn&#8217;t wait for inspiration. Carpenters don&#8217;t need inspiration to make a table. It&#8217;s their profession. If they waited for inspiration to hammer in a nail or sand a plank of wood, they&#8217;d never make anything. The same holds true for writers. The aspiring writer needs to sit in front of his or her computer and start writing, no matter how he or she feels. The amazing thing is that a kind of magic occurs when writers are working &#8211; they get inspired by their own characters and sentences! The secret is this: inspiration is to be found in one&#8217;s own writing, in a wonderful sentence or a great metaphor or a surprising character! I suspect that for carpenters it&#8217;s much the same &#8211; they get inspired by the beauty that they create.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that aspiring writers avoid thinking about selling their book while they are writing. Their only goal should be to write the best novel they can. That is hard enough to do! If they are telling a story that they feel passionate about, then that passion will carry them through to the end of the project, even if it takes five or more years. So novelists should only pick a topic &#8211; or characters &#8211; that they feel passionate about.</p>
<p>Once a writer has finished a novel, he or she can then start thinking about selling it. First, they should try to get a good literary agent. And by &#8220;good,&#8221; I mainly mean someone who understands their work and loves it. There are many places to find lists of agents. It may help to identify the agents of your favorite writers and approach them. After all &#8211; in theory, at least &#8211; those are the people who share your taste.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the last attribute any potential novelist needs: patience. It can take one, two, three years or more to write a great book. And it can take another couple of years or more to find a publisher. And there is no guarantee that once it comes out it will be reviewed in the media or stocked by the best bookshops. And no guarantee that it will sell well &#8211; which means that almost no author can count on his or her publisher wanting the next book. There is very little loyalty these days. So all writers need to develop an enormous amount of patience. Otherwise, they tend to become nervous wrecks!</p>

<p>Matthew Reilly &#8211; Write What You Like to Read</p>
<p>Matthew Reilly is one of Australia&#8217;s most successful authors. After self publishing his first book at age nineteen, he has since been published in over twenty countries and sold over 3.5 million books. In this interview he spoke about his writing career and his advice for anyone trying to succeed as a writer.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Matthew - I usually work from about 9am to 1pm. I find I think best and work best in the morning. I used to write all day, but as with anything, the more you do, the better you get, and so now it doesn&#8217;t take as long. That said, I am still just as exhausted mentally after half a day&#8217;s writing as I used to be after a full day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Darrell - I know that when it comes to writing, action is your middle name (and possibly even your first and last name). Do you normally plot out your novels in advance or do you allow the characters to lead the way?</p>
<p>Matthew - I plot out each novel in full before I even start page 1 &#8212; I use big sheets of cardboard to map out the whole story. Plot, pace and action are very important to me, and I can only see that when I have the whole story in front of me. I have done this since CONTEST and continue to do it: I still have the cardboard sheet for SCARECROW AND THE ARMY OF THIEVES beside my desk!</p>
<p>That said, action without good characters is meaningless, so once I have laid out my plot, I then &#8220;people it&#8221; with characters that I believe readers will cheer for or find interesting. Of course, villains play a big role, too, and in the new Scarecrow book, the choice of villain was pivotal.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve had some of your books optioned for movies and you’ve even had some interest in small film making yourself. Do you think we’ll get to see a Matthew Reilly book turned into a feature length movie?</p>
<p>Matthew - I&#8217;ve had a few false starts with Hollywood &#8212; I optioned ICE STATION to Paramount, but that never got made; and I sold a TV script called LITERARY SUPERSTARS to Sony and ABC that had Darren Star producing and Jenna Elfman starring, and that fell through because of the &#8217;07-&#8217;08 Writer&#8217;s Strike. But I sold HOVER CAR RACER to Disney a few years back and they&#8217;re still keen on it, and SCARECROW is currently under option with a big production company, so there is still hope.</p>
<p>The key thing about Hollywood and my books is this: money. My books are very big in scale and that means it&#8217;ll take 100 million bucks to even think about turning one of my novels into a decent movie. Which means getting a top director and big movie star. So in the end, that means waiting and being patient. I hope that one day, a movie of one of my books will be made, but I don&#8217;t sit by the phone waiting for it to happen. I just get on with writing the next novel and entertaining my fans.</p>
<p>That said, I still write screenplays in between the books, and that keeps me in touch with people in Hollywood, which can only help.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way a writer can promote themselves and their books?</p>
<p>Matthew - When you&#8217;re starting out, do every interview you can, even for the local newspaper &#8212; because you never know who reads the local newspaper. A while back, I did an interview with a local paper, and it was read by a national current affairs TV show, who asked for an interview. In Australia, radio is also very powerful.</p>
<p>In the end, do everything. You can&#8217;t just leave your book on the shelf to be found by browsers &#8212; no matter how shy you are (and many authors are shy) you have to get out there and tell people that your book is in bookstores, waiting to be read and enjoyed!</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the future holds for hard copy books now that ebooks are here?</p>
<p>Matthew - I can see a future where hard copy books coexist with ebooks, with each occupying about 50% of the market. The &#8220;hard copy book&#8221; is an awesome piece of technology: it&#8217;s sturdy, it requires no batteries, and you can hurl it around or stuff it in a bag; plus, many people just like &#8217;em (I myself find that I retain more information reading a hard copy than an ebook). Ebooks are the future, for sure, and younger readers who grow up with them will happily read them, but I don&#8217;t see them obliterating hard copies entirely.</p>
<p>For authors, I don&#8217;t think this matters too much. My skill as a fiction writer is entertaining a reader with words &#8212; whether they are on a page or a screen, I don&#8217;t think it matters. That said, printers and bookstores will have to adapt to this brave new world.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to make it as a writer?</p>
<p>Matthew - Write what you would read yourself. Believe me, you can&#8217;t fake enthusiasm, and I firmly believe that my readers see my enthusiasm in every page of my work. I love action thrillers. Really love them. This is why you won&#8217;t see a &#8220;Matthew Reilly Book of Poetry&#8221; anytime soon &#8212; fans of poetry would spot my inexperience in an instant. But when it comes to action and thrills, I know (and love) every movie and book in the genre. I thrive in it and because of that, I can thus stretch the conventions of the thriller genre and take readers to new limits.</p>
<p>On the practical side, if that first novel doesn&#8217;t find a publisher, start writing another one. My first book, CONTEST, was rejected by everyone, so I famously self-published it. In the middle of self-publishing CONTEST, I sat down and started ICE STATION. Now, at that stage, I had nothing. No book deal. Just lots of rejection letters and boxes of self-published books. But I started that second book anyway. And while CONTEST was ultimately discovered, it was ICE STATION that catapulted me around the world as an author of note. Write that second book &#8212; you&#8217;ll also have learned stuff while writing the first one and it may well be better! I think that happened with me and ICE STATION.</p>

<p>Mark Edwards &#8211; Two Bestsellers Hit Top of UK Amazon Kindle Chart</p>
<p>Together with his &#8216;writer in arms&#8217; Louise Voss, Mark Edwards wrote a book entitled, Catch Your Death. As it sat at number one on the UK Amazon Kindle Bestseller Chart, another book written by the pair &#8211; Killing Cupid &#8211; sat at position four.</p>
<p>This is a pretty amazing feat for any writer. In this interview I spoke to Mark about how he became a writer and where he sees the future for authors.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Mark - I started writing about fifteen years ago after I left uni. My first novel was written longhand in a series of notepads. It was terrible, but once I’d got it out of my system I was able to write a slightly-less terrible novel which I typed up on a contraption called a Sharp Fontwriter (PCs were quite expensive back then) and, following the instructions in the Writers’ Handbook, posted it off to several agents. I got some interest straight away and thought ‘this is easy!’ But then they changed their minds and I wrote another novel, called The Liberators. This time I landed an agent who told me I was going to be rich and famous. I told everyone I knew I was going to be rich and famous.</p>
<p>I didn’t get rich or famous. After wiping the egg off my face, and learning an important lesson about hubris, I kept plugging away. I wrote another book, then another… Then a weird twist occurred. The BBC were making a documentary about wannabe writers and I was chosen to be on it. It didn’t lead to anything except being recognised once by a bus driver and receiving a nice email from another writer called Louise Voss who was in the same boat as me. Louise and I struck up an email correspondence.</p>
<p>This is the point in the movie where the clock’s hands would spin round… A few years later, when I was agentless, Louise and I wrote a book together called Killing Cupid, then another called Catch Your Death. We weren’t able to sell them. Then I started having kids, got a good job and gave up on the writing dream. It was a great relief. No more stress. No more rejection. I’d tried my best but I hadn’t succeeded.</p>
<p>Last year, after reading all the stories about the Kindle and self-published writers finding success, I persuaded Louise that we had nothing to lose by putting our books online ourselves. We rewrote them and updated them, and then put them live, starting with Killing Cupid. It took about three months to get into the top 100 on Amazon.co.uk at which point we released Catch Your Death. That one took 3 weeks to reach the top 100 - and another 3 days to shoot into the top 10. As I write Catch Your Death is No.1 and Killing Cupid is No.4.</p>
<p>It’s been a long, tortuous journey… but hopefully this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Darrell - It must be quite different working with a writing partner. Can you describe how this works in practical terms?</p>
<p>Mark - With Killing Cupid it was quite easy because it has a dual narrative and we wrote alternate chapters. I wrote the male character and Louise the female. We did the whole thing by email because I was in Japan at the time. Catch Your Death was trickier because it has a third person viewpoint, but we divided up the chapters and plotted ahead as much as we could. I don’t think you can see the join; nobody has commented on it anyway. We work very well together - Louise is stronger on characterisation and I think I’m stronger on plot, which is a great combination. And we share all the ‘business’ side of things too. I highly recommend finding a collaborator!</p>
<p>Darrell - Between yourself and Louise you achieved a fantastic coup by using a particular naming convention in the title of your book “Catch Your Death”. Can you tell us a little about that?</p>
<p>Mark - I don’t want what we did - briefly - with the subtitle of Catch Your Death to overshadow our success because I personally don’t think it had much to do with it. I think people are looking for a reason to explain something extraordinary - the first book by British indie authors to hit No.1 in the UK and the fastest climb through the top 100 to that spot. This has happened because of years and years of work and because thousands of people who had read and enjoyed Killing Cupid bought Catch Your Death in a burst, sending it into the spotlight - at which point people read the blurb, thought it sounded great and decided to give it a try. The title has been just ‘Catch Your Death’ for two days and we are still No.1.</p>
<p>Darrell - Killing Cupid has been optioned as a BBC TV series. How did this come about?</p>
<p>Mark - Killing Cupid was optioned by the BBC to make a 2-part drama but it’s actually fallen through now - however, the producer wants to make it into a film instead! We are in talks at the moment.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way a writer can promote themselves i.e. Facebook, Twitter, book signings etc.?</p>
<p>Mark - It’s all about finding readers - people who love books and are willing to give something new a go. Kindle owners are quite adventurous and willing to try books by writers who are not established. We got ourselves known by networking with other indie writers who were willing to be interviewed thus making a connection with their readers - and making some good friends in the process. There is a fantastic, supportive community of indie writers which I feel very proud to be part of. I don’t know if Facebook or Twitter make much of a difference, although we have just set up a new Facebook group called the Summer Book Club (facebook.com/summerbookclub) to get readers and writers together to talk about a number of books.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you see the future for authors, publishers and booksellers now that ebooks are on the scene?</p>
<p>Mark - It’s so difficult to say. A year or two ago, what we’ve done would have been unthinkable. This is a golden era for writers because for the first time in many years - possibly ever - there is a playing field that might not be quite level but at least we are allowed on it. (I feel a bit like a non-league club who is beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final at the moment, with Karin Slaughter at No.2!)</p>
<p>But publishers, or legacy publishers as Konrath calls them, will eventually wrest back control, I’m sure, and of course publishers do great things. Every writer can benefit from a good editor, and it’s exhausting having to do all your own PR and marketing. I imagine what will happen is that the big publishers - including Amazon themselves - will re-establish dominance and we will see regular breakout indie hits. Just like in music.</p>
<p>I think the future for booksellers is bleaker, which is a shame as I used to love bookshops and have spent many many happy hours of my life browsing and buying from them. But I went to Waterstones today and it felt a bit like being in a museum. It was almost empty, despite the thousands of shoppers teeming outside, except for the children’s section. I think that fiction will go almost wholly digital first, although it will take a few years, while children’s books will remain on paper for a long time. And some books - those that are more image-based like photography books - will remain in print. But what do I know? I’m just guessing like everyone else. All I know is that I love books, have thousands of them, probably more than anyone else I know, and was vehemently opposed to the Kindle - until I got one. Now I couldn’t imagine life without it and I don’t enjoy reading on paper any more.</p>

<p>Micaela Wendell &#8211; Young Ebook Writer Makes Waves on Amazon</p>
<p>Micaela Wendell was only thirteen when she wrote the first draft of her book, &#8220;The Branding.&#8221; Three years later the book recently enjoyed popularity as one of the most successful free ebooks on Amazon.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you achieve publishing success at such a young age?</p>
<p>Micaela - Ever since I was little, I&#8217;ve loved writing. All through my grade school years, I&#8217;d write short stories and a few poems whenever I could.</p>
<p>In fifth grade, I was tired of writing short stories all the time. I wanted to bring my writing to the next level as well as follow my dream to become a published writer. After writing a good bit of the book, I lost my inspiration for a while, and I stopped working on it. When I went back to write more of it, I read it over and really didn&#8217;t like it at all. I deleted it, and I tried writing a book again in seventh grade. I used my plot and characters from my first novel idea to help shape what I wanted for The Branding. My seventh grade theology teacher, Mrs. Julia Schuster (author of Flowers for Elvis), encouraged me to write more of my book. I eventually finished it in the summer before eighth grade.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; How did you end up getting published?</p>
<p>Micaela - Since Mrs. Shuster already was a published author from BelleBooks, she suggested that I send in my query letter and first three chapters to Belle Bridge Books.</p>
<p>I wrote my own query letter and formatted the manuscript to the guidelines my Writer&#8217;s Market said was appropriate. After sending it off via e-mail, I anxiously awaited a reply, and when they e-mailed me back (and after I freaked out a little to myself), they asked for the rest of the manuscript. After helping me polish the book a little more, they deemed it ready for publication. It was such a crazy ride.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; Do you think you&#8217;ll pursue a career as a writer?</p>
<p>Micaela - My long-term goal changes from time to time. Since I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what I want to major in during college.</p>
<p>However, there are two things I want to achieve no matter what. One is to continue my writing career into adulthood and (hopefully) become famous or get one of my books made into a movie. The other is I want to join the Marines and either go into the reserves or become active duty personnel. I&#8217;ve wanted to become a Marine ever since I was in grade school, and I don&#8217;t want to give up on that dream anytime soon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Jay Parker &#8211; Writers Need to be Sociable to Succeed</p>
<p>Richard Jay Parker&#8217;s novel is entitled &#8220;Stop Me&#8221; which is ironic as he looks to have an unstoppable career ahead of him. Having worked as a television writer for twenty-two years, at age thirty he decided to try his hand at writing novels.</p>
<p>Ten years of disappointment followed, but his book &#8220;Stop Me&#8221; was picked up by publishers Allison and Busby and he has since achieved publishing success. In this interview he spoke about his writing and how he felt a writer could best market themselves.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Richard - I’m lucky enough to have the whole day for writing and I usually close myself in my office.  I circle for a while - email, Twitter etc - but as I start pretty early I can afford to do this.  I tend to write in concentrated bursts and then fizzle by mid afternoon.  After that I’ll work on edits etc.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you plot your books in advance or do you let them go in whatever direction feels right?</p>
<p>Richard - I like to know where I’m going so have a start and a finish in mind but all the territory in between is fertile land. That was certainly the case with STOP ME.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you tell us about the Curzon Group?</p>
<p>Richard - The Curzon Group was set up by Matt Lynn to promote British thriller authors although it’s a very informal band of writers who meet up from time to time to promote their work.  Our favourite gig so far was signing holiday reads in airport bookshops.  We needed our passports to attend.</p>
<p>Darrell - It’s quite a clever idea arranging for readers through your website to receive an email from the evil Vacation Killer. What sort of response have you had to this promotion?</p>
<p>Richard - The Vacation Killer email has creeped out a lot of people.  When you send it via my site to a friend they receive a message saying a girl is about to die at a particular time - the time that they’ve just opened the email.  The response has been good but I’d love to see it bouncing around even more.  You can send it to your friends by visiting <a href="http://www.richardjayparker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.richardjayparker.com</a></p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way a writer can promote themselves?</p>
<p>Richard - I think all writers have to be sociable online now.  It doesn’t seem to be sufficient to just have a website.  Interacting with readers is vital and you can get the sort of instant feedback that authors would have killed for a decade ago.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you see the future for writers and publishers now that ebooks have arrived?</p>
<p>Richard - There are pros and cons re ebooks and they’re being debated ad nauseum.  I personally think ebooks are a great way for writers to find a readership. The industry is still feeling its way through at the moment and there are many creases to iron out.  Broadly I think they can enhance the reading experience from the immediacy of being able to access the work to readers’ desire to easily sample different books. I don’t believe they’ll outmode traditional books.  I can see the two cohabiting very nicely and readers making up their own mind about which is the most convenient.  I don’t lose sleep over this though.  Ultimately, I don’t have any control over the situation.  All I can do is continue to write and hope people will want to read my work however it’s presented to them.</p>

<p>John Marsden &#8211; 1000 Words a Day Leads to Successful Writing Career</p>
<p>John Marsden is one of Australia&#8217;s most successful authors. Born in 1950, he had his first book &#8211; So Much to Tell You &#8211; published in 1987. Since then he has written or edited more than 40 books. His books have been translated into nine languages and he has sold more than five million worldwide.</p>
<p>Prior to succeeding as a writer, he had worked in a variety of jobs including pizza delivery and working in an abattoir.</p>
<p>His book So Much to Tell You won the “Book of the Year” as awarded by the Children’s Book Council of Australia. He has also won various other awards including the 2006 Lloyd O’Neil Award for contributions to Australian publishing. In 2008 he was nominated for the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, the world&#8217;s largest youth literature award and second largest literature prize on earth.</p>
<p>Probably his largest success has come from his &#8216;Tomorrow&#8217; series. Tomorrow, When the War Began has sold more than two million copies worldwide and was recently made into a successful movie. It is the first book in a series of seven with a follow up trilogy entitled The Ellie Chronicles.</p>
<p>In this interview, John spoke about a typical writing day and how he saw the future of publishing now that ebooks have arrived.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>John - When was I not a writer? I always loved stories, hearing them and telling them. I always enjoyed language. And for as long as I can remember, I’ve been an avid reader. Writing just came naturally to me.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>John - Many hours of procrastination, before I reluctantly sit at the desk and start rereading the last page or two of the book I’m currently working on.</p>
<p>Gradually I get drawn into the story again and almost unconsciously start writing. I try to do 1000 words a day.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you plot your stories out or do you just start at page one and see where the novel takes you?</p>
<p>John - I totally just start at page 1 and see what happens. Of course I have some vague idea of where the book is likely to go, but it often goes in unexpected directions.</p>
<p>Darrell - You obviously have a love both of teaching and writing. What do you think are the most important things kids have to learn to realise their potential in life?</p>
<p>John - I don’t think I can answer that. But the children whose lives are built on strong foundations are obviously in a much better position than the ones whose lives are built on chaos.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I try to add a bit of cement to the foundations of children whose lives are not well-based.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>John - If you’re writing non-fiction, make sure you have your own voice! If you’re writing fiction, try to give each character an individual voice.</p>
<p>Darrell - What’s your opinion of ebooks and what do you think will happen to hard copy books now that ebooks are here?</p>
<p>John - Hard copy books seem to be surviving quite well. I enjoy reading ebooks occasionally, but so far I don’t find them a satisfactory substitute for the tactile interactions with paper and text that hardcopy books provide!</p>

<p>Saffina Desforges &#8211; 700 Book Sales a Day and in the UK Amazon Top Ten</p>
<p>Saffina Desforges is in an enviable position. Her book, Sugar and Spice, landed her in the UK Amazon Top Ten ebook list. What made her story even more amazing is that an agent could not be found to represent her novel because they felt &#8216;uncomfortable&#8217; about the subject matter.</p>
<p>This is what Saffina had to say about her writing.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you end up becoming a writer?</p>
<p>Saffina - I didn’t choose writing, it chose me. It’s the only way I can shut the voices up! Seriously though, I have always written, just never seriously. When I met Mark (my co-writer) on Youwriteon, he convinced me that I ‘had something’ and it kind of snowballed from there. And here we are.</p>
<p>Darrell - One article quotes you as saying that you’re, “selling 500 copies a day of a book that agents feared would be ‘too difficult to represent’.” Can you tell us what the basic storyline is of the book and why agents shied away?</p>
<p>Saffina - We are now selling 700 plus books a day and are the only ‘indie’ book in the Top 10 on Amazon UK. The storyline is ‘uncomfortable’ as it deals with the inner-most workings of the mind of a man with paedophillic tendancies and also includes references to child murders. I HOPE that it has been handled sensitively. I guess that agents weren’t sure that they could easily pitch the idea to publishers, so we decided to see for ourselves whether people would read it or not. I guess the fact that today, we are #2 in the UK store, proves that they will!</p>
<p>Darrell - Your book Sugar and Spice sold more than 15,000 copies in March alone. To what do you attribute your success?</p>
<p>Saffina - I was asked this question yesterday by a journalist writing for The Sunday Telegraph and I will give you the same, honest answer: I don’t know! Don’t get me wrong, we obviously thought it was a great story-line, or we wouldn’t have written it and the work that has gone into it (and marketing it) deserves some reward, but I don’t think we ever thought an indie, completely unknown, debut novel would do so well against well-established writers already selling thousands.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think are the best promotional things that a writer can do to market their book?</p>
<p>Saffina - Build a social network. Simple. ;-)</p>
<p>Darrell - What are you working on next?</p>
<p>Saffina - We have several big projects on the go. The US edition of Sugar &amp; Spice has just been released and we are in the process of writing the first book of The Rose Red Crime Series, Snow White - for publication late summer. This a commercial crime thriller series, set in the modern day, based on fairy tales.</p>
<p>Autumn will see the release of Equilibrium: First Blood; the first of a dark, urban fantasy trilogy and we might even see another title before the end of the year!</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you give to someone about to publish their own book?</p>
<p>Saffina - Be prepared for some damn hard work and get out your bullet-proof vest!</p>

<p>Loucinda McGary &#8211; Free Kindle Bestseller Hit Number One</p>
<p>When I interviewed Loucinda McGary, she had just had a book reach the number one spot on the Kindle Bestseller List for Free books. A successful romance writer, she speaks about the craft of writing, marketing her books and how she stays in contact with her readers.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a normal day of writing to me?</p>
<p>Loucinda - I am totally not a morning person, as anyone who knows me will verify. So I do my email, blogging and any other promotion or business related things in the morning. My optimum writing time is between 1 and 5 pm, that&#8217;s when I do most of my first draft stuff. Sometimes I go until 6 if the words are flowing. After dinner, I do my critiques and revisions. This is my routine Monday through Friday. If I am under deadline or I&#8217;m really &#8220;in the writing groove&#8221; I&#8217;ll do the same on Saturday and Sunday. I&#8217;ve even been known to work until the wee hours of night on Friday and Saturday if need be.</p>
<p>Darrell - Most of your ebooks have a price tag of $4.79. How important is price in relation to sales?</p>
<p>Loucinda - My own personal opinion is that it is very important and my sense is that readers are less likely to spend much over $5. Unfortunately, I have no control over the price of my books. My publisher sets all the prices. Thus far, the highest I have seen the Kindle versions of any of my books listed for is $5.59. I would hope my publisher does not set the price any higher than that. All three of my books were first issued as mass market paperbacks with a $6.99 price.</p>
<p>Darrell - You currently have one of your ebooks - Wild Sight - for free on the Amazon Kindle website. From a marketing perspective, how do you think this will help your career?</p>
<p>Loucinda - Again, this was my publisher&#8217;s decision and they did not consult, nor even inform me when they did it. The only way I knew that Wild Sight was offered as a free download was because I received a notice from Google Alerts that it was #1 on the Kindle Free Bestseller list. I was thrilled and immediately spread the word on Facebook and elsewhere online. Wild Sight remained at #1 for several days and this was for all free Kindle ebooks! Even after it was no longer offered for free (my publisher only did the promotion for a week), Wild Sight remained in the Kindle Paid Top 100 (peaking at #54) for about ten days, so that was a definite boost.</p>
<p>My other two books, The Treasures of Venice and The Wild Irish Sea also saw a big upswing in Kindle sales. All three books also sold more print copies, and I saw a nice increase in fan mail, which I always love. So I would say a resounding yes, that offering a book for a free download for a week was a very positive and worthwhile experience.</p>
<p>Darrell - Some romance writers have reported that the Nook seems to be a better site for their romance novels. Any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Loucinda - Actually, Wild Sight was also offered as a free download on the Nook at the same time, but I didn&#8217;t track any sales figures for that venue, so I really don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Darrell - Romance, paranormal and mystery books seem to head the list of ebook sellers. Do you think certain genres have an advantage in relation to ebook sales?</p>
<p>Loucinda - Sorry, I don&#8217;t have any idea. Certainly romance and mystery are the bestselling genres overall (along with science fiction), so it would make sense they would have more ebook sales. I know quite a few romance authors are putting their previously published backlist up as ebooks and are excited about reaching a new and wider audience.</p>
<p>Darrell - What marketing tools do you use to promote yourself e.g. magazine advertising, Facebook, direct email?</p>
<p>Loucinda - Of course, I belong to Romance Writers of America, both the national organization and a couple of the smaller chapters. I highly recommend writers join some kind of professional writing organization, as I find interacting and networking with other writers invaluable. I attend RWA&#8217;s national conference when I can, and also attend smaller regional conferences and workshops.</p>
<p>I have done two magazine ads, but they were expensive and I honestly don&#8217;t know if they were worth it. I&#8217;ve done a few local book signings, but with limited success. Most of my promotion is online. I&#8217;ve done &#8216;blog tours&#8217; for all three of my books, and my publisher is convinced these are the most effective way to reach readers with very little cost. I do have a website (<a href="http://www.loucindamcgary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.LoucindaMcgary.com</a>), a personal blog (<a href="http://www.auntycindy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.auntycindy.blogspot.com</a>), am part of a very successful group blog (<a href="http://www.romancebandits.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.romancebandits.blogspot.com</a>), have a personal newsletter group, and am on Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>I started building my online presence before I ever sold a book, and I think that has significantly helped build my name recognition. I recommend writers do the same as soon as they are at the point of seriously submitting their work.</p>

<p>Jack Dann &#8211; Award Winning Author Shares his Keys To Writing Success</p>
<p>Jack Dann is something of a living legend in the world of speculative fiction. Born in New York State, he has lived in both the US and Australia during his long and successful career. In that time he has authored or edited more than seventy books including his bestselling novel The Memory Cathedral which took some six years to research.</p>
<p>He is the author of The Man Who Melted, High Steel (with Jack C. Haldeman II), The Silent, Bad Medicine and The Rebel, among other works.</p>
<p>He is a recipient of the Nebula Award, the Australian Aurealis Award (twice), the Ditmar Award (four times), the World Fantasy Award, the Peter McNamara Achievement Award, the Peter McNamara Convenors Award for Excellence, and the Premios Gilgam&#233;s de Narrativa Fantastica award. Dann has also been honored by the Mark Twain Society (Esteemed Knight).</p>
<p>In this interview he spoke about the craft of writing and what he saw as being the keys to writing success.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Jack - Alas, I wish I could. Take today, we&#8217;re having major renovations done at the farm, so I spent some time terrified on the scaffolding, and went to my studio to write. I&#8217;ll have about three more hours to work, then will have to go to an appointment in a nearby town, which will take a few hours. Then back to the house, cook dinner, and maybe, just maybe, get some more work done. Other days I write at the house all day without interruption&#8230;or I spend a full day at the studio&#8230;or, if I&#8217;m at the flat in Melbourne, I&#8217;ll work there continuously for days. That&#8217;s actual writing. There is also the daily business e-mail, anthology work, and research&#8230;and other related tasks such as mentoring, etc.</p>
<p>Darrell - When you’re writing a novel, do you plot the entire book in advance or work it out as you go?</p>
<p>Jack - Well&#8230;entire is a pretty big word! Some novels come to my mind visually, others come to mind as action: as plot. When the idea of my Civil War novel The Silent came to me, I glimpsed the plot as if it was a road winding out into the distance. The Memory Cathedral, on the other hand, came to me as a visual image of Gothic-looking aircraft passing over Florence. (I was having a drink in lobby of the Algonquin Hotel and reading a book about Leonardo da Vinci.) I later &#8216;discovered&#8217; that the da Vinci novel was in the &#8220;What if&#8221; category. What if Leonardo could find a way to build the war machines he had composed like serene still-life&#8217;s on paper? What if he could see the results of his inventions on an actual field of battle? How would he react? Would that knowledge change him? I wrote the book to find out!</p>
<p>I always know the direction a book is going, but the plots never go quite where I intend. The process is an organic one for me and always full of surprises. With The Silent, I remember eavesdropping on my protagonist while I was daydreaming at my desk. So I wrote down what I &#8216;heard&#8217;. It became the prologue to the novel, written in Edmund &#8220;Mundy&#8221; McDowell voice.</p>
<p>This is it:</p>
<p>I wrote this, and then Uncle Randolph went over it and fixed my sentences and punctuation and broke everything up into sections and put in some of the quotations and fixed whatever else could be fixed. Uncle Randolph and Doctor Keys think it&#8217;s &#8220;therapeutical&#8221; for me to write down what happened. They think if I can just write about all the terrible things that happened, they&#8217;ll sort of go away or something and I won&#8217;t think they were all my fault.</p>
<p>I think that Uncle Randolph shouldn&#8217;t listen to doctors.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried to write like everybody talked, but with some of the colored dialect it was hard to write it down, so I just did the best I could. Uncle Randolph went over that too. And he took out some of the swear words, which he said wouldn&#8217;t read well because he said I had too many of them, but he left some in so you could get a feel for the truth. He didn&#8217;t take out anything important, though, even though he said it made his heart sick to read it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s done now, and if anything&#8217;s wrong it&#8217;s probably my fault.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s mostly true.</p>
<p>&#8212;Edmund &#8220;Mundy&#8221; McDowell</p>
<p>November 16, 1864</p>
<p>Scranton, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>I was half-way into the book when I wrote the bit above. What surprised me was to &#8216;discover&#8217; that Mundy &#8216;composed&#8217; that prologue in Scranton, Pennsylvania. But Scranton wasn&#8217;t supposed to be in the book! So&#8230;I had to figure out how he came to end up there. And that&#8217;s sort of how my plots get made.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you get past writer’s block?</p>
<p>Jack - I&#8217;ve always considered writer&#8217;s block&#8212;or what&#8217;s often called writer&#8217;s block&#8212;to be part of the natural process of writing. I&#8217;ll be writing day after day, and then everything will come to a complete stop.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the signal that I need input. I need information. I need to do research. I need to feed my unconscious and then give it some time to work things out. So&#8230;I read anything that feels relevant, whether it is or not. I sleep a lot, watch television, go to movies, and try new cooking recipes. Then, suddenly, I&#8217;ll feel that nagging urge to write and will write until the little man who inhabits my unconscious tells me it&#8217;s time for another refill.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you get your ideas and inspiration?</p>
<p>Jack - Ideas are the easy part. When I give workshops, I&#8217;ll often pick up a magazine and pass it around to the writers. Might be Science News or The Economist or Wired&#8230;or Women&#8217;s Weekly. Anything will do. We always find more plot ideas just by flipping through the pages than we could write in a year. And that&#8217;s because ideas are everywhere. Jane Austen wrote about her little village where nothing much really ever happened; yet we&#8217;re still fascinated with the triumphs and disappointments of her characters.</p>
<p>Ideas are everywhere. Inspiration&#8230;well, that&#8217;s something else. Inspiration is just something that sometimes happens. Writing is about perspiration. Now if you work on a story until little droplets of blood appear on your forehead, then you might just find some of that oft-mentioned inspiration.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the secret to writing success?</p>
<p>Jack - Writing is the secret. Writing whenever you can. Writing wherever you can. Writing, reading, writing, and then writing some more.</p>
<p>Darrell - What would be the main advice you would give to new writers?</p>
<p>Jack - Don&#8217;t quit your day job. Write before you go to work. You must&#8212;ah, okay, here&#8217;s what I came up with years ago, an article I wrote for Writer&#8217;s Digest entitled &#8220;Keys to the Kingdom.&#8221; Do what it says. That&#8217;s all I got.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You must begin. Every day you must write, no matter what.</li>
<li>Being a professional simply means you write and publish. So even though you know you&#8217;re the next Hemingway or Faulkner, you&#8217;ll probably need a job. That&#8217;s good&#8212;it puts you in the midst of things, into the middle of life&#8230;you know, the stuff you want to write about.</li>
<li>Give the best part of every day to yourself. You must try to write every day!</li>
<li>Make appointments with yourself to write.</li>
<li>Copy. I don&#8217;t mean plagiarize, but find writers you admire, read and reread their best work, dissect their prose sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, memorize paragraphs if you have to, but get into the weave of the writer&#8217;s work. It will give an unconscious form and balance to your own work. Don&#8217;t worry, no one else will know. You will put these unconscious &#8220;forms&#8221; through your own sensorium. When you sit down to write, forget about your favorite authors.</li>
<li>Read constantly and widely.</li>
<li>Be prepared to be surprised and upset by what you write&#8230;and by what you think. Serious writing forces you to come to terms with yourself&#8230;forces you to explore private demons.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to be a critic while you&#8217;re writing. Once you have a draft, or become blocked, then you must rethink and rework and be as hard on yourself as if you were writing for The New York Times Book Review.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re having trouble with a sentence or a passage or a plot twist, ask yourself if something doesn&#8217;t need to be cut.</li>
<li>If you find yourself blocked, take a break and read. Take notes, read, take more notes. Usually a writer gets blocked when he or she needs more information. It&#8217;s a natural part of the process.</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. Your unconscious knows more than you do, so if you get an urge to buy a book on the flora of Afghanistan, buy it! Chances are in a week, month, or a year, you&#8217;ll need it.</li>
<li>Rewrite everything until you feel that what&#8217;s on paper corresponds as closely as possible to that wonderful image you originally had in your head.</li>
<li>Keep working toward making clear sentences and building solid story structures. Style is really only transparency of thought and idea.</li>
<li>Read and reread Strunk and White&#8217;s The Elements of Style. Then read it again.</li>
<li>And of course you must send your work out to editors. Don&#8217;t write long cover letters. When your manuscript is returned, send it out again&#8230;the next day!</li>
<li>The easier alternative to all of the above is&#8230;to remain a reader!<br>(This acknowledgment must appear with the work: &#8220;Keys to the Kingdom&#8221; by Jack Dann.

<p>Chris Smith &#8211; An Overnight Success &#8211; And it Only Took Twenty-seven Years</p>
<p>It&#8217;s every writer&#8217;s dream. You write your novel. It gets published and you become an overnight success. It almost sounds too good to be true. In fact, it is too good to be true. Writer Chris Smith had been writing for twenty-seven years by the time he wrote &#8220;Fifth Avenue&#8221;. But hard work and remaining focused on his passion finally paid off for him.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your novel “Fifth Avenue” became an Amazon Top 100 Best Seller in just five days. What did you do that was different to achieve such instant success?</p>
<p>Chris - I was as surprised as anyone when it happened, and I was especially surprised that it stayed on the Top 100 list for over three months.  I wrote the best book that I could–I wrote and rewrote.  I also made certain that the cover competed with anything coming out of New York.  Many indie writers do their own covers–and it looks as if they did.  I spent a bit of money to have mine done professionally and I think that helped.</p>
<p>Darrell - The cover of Fifth Avenue is simple, but striking. If there is one thing you would recommend authors consider in relation to cover art, what would it be?</p>
<p>Chris - You need to make sure that when it’s reduced to a thumbnail image on Amazon, it’s still easy to read and see.  Also, at that small size, it still needs to captivate and create interest.  Red is a striking color.  For obvious reasons, red also goes along with the thriller genre.  The font was critical–it had to look good large and small.  I think we achieved that.</p>
<p>Darrell - You are selling your book for ninety-nine cents. What part does pricing play?</p>
<p>Chris - Actually, I fluctuate between .99 cents and $2.99.  At .99 cents, I earn .35 cents per book.  But at $2.99, I earn $2.05 per book.  In other words, for every $2.99 book sold, I’d need to sell six at .99 cents to make the same amount of money.  That said, at .99 cents, I rise higher on the genre lists and the book gets more attention.  So, pricing plays a huge factor in a book’s success.  I experiment all the time with it.</p>
<p>Darrell - What are the main marketing tools you use to communicate with your readers e.g. advertising, Facebook?</p>
<p>Chris - I did very little advertising at the start because, frankly, I thought only my parents, family and friends would buy it.  I did take to my Facebook and Twitter accounts and used those because they were free.  But when the book took off, I purchased an ad on Goodreads and also did a giveaway there.  That gave me additional exposure.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you plot your stories first or just let your characters lead the way?</p>
<p>Chris - It all begins with an idea.  For instance, in my new book, the Wall Street thriller “Running of the Bulls,” which is nearly finished, I actually got the idea in Pamploma while getting ready to run with the bulls.  I was surrounded by thousands of people and I thought, “Wouldn’t it be cool if one of them was a Wall Street bull and that he gets assassinated while running with the bulls?  Buy why?  Who did it?  What’s their motivation?”  After that initial idea, the characters definitely lead the way. And when they do, I just sit back and let them grow and take over, while occasionally shaping the story if I don’t like the course it’s taking.</p>
<p>Darrell - What would be the most important piece of advice you would give to new writers?</p>
<p>Chris - It’s such a cliche, but it’s true–perseverance.  I’ve been writing for 27 years–14 of them professionally as a movie critic.  I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in English.  I took many writing courses and worked with great teachers.  And I worked hard to find my voice and hone my craft, often writing deep into the night because the day job had to pay the bills.  FIFTH AVENUE has sold into the six figures at this point, but look how long it took for me to get there.  I’m hardly an overnight success.  But I finally achieved success through hard work.  Here’s one thing young writers might do (as I did).  Walk into a bookstore.  See all of those books?  People wrote them.  They were focused and talented and they wrote them.  They had the same frustrations while writing those books that everyone else has–but they worked through those frustrations and got their books finished and published.  For years, every time I walked into a bookstore, I thought, “If they can do it, so can I.  Why are they any different from me?”  You need to really want it.  If you do–and if you have real talent and drive–you’ll get there.  Even if it takes 27 years.</p>

<p>Bill Gourgey &#8211; One Million Readers and Counting</p>
<p>There are new avenues appearing every day for writers in this explosive era of self publishing. One of the most interesting is Wattpad, a Canadian based company that promotes itself as &#8216;YouTube for ebooks&#8217;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the link:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.wattpad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.wattpad.com/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Writers first make their stories available through Wattpad. Readers can then download the Wattpad application and enjoy the ebooks on their mobile phones or other portable reading devices. It&#8217;s just another sign of this brave new publishing world that we&#8217;re living in.</p>
<p>One of the most successful of these writers is Bill Gourgey who recently received one million reads of his book &#8220;Glide&#8221; as well as rave reviews on multiple websites. Described as &#8216;green sci-fi&#8217; by Bill, it fills a unique gap in this new age of publishing.</p>
<p>In this interview I spoke to Bill about how he became a writer, his thoughts on the best promotional methods for writers and how he thinks the planet can be saved from its worst enemy &#8211; us!</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Bill - At the risk of invoking clich&#233;, it all started with being a reader. When I was a kid I read everything and anything I could. Luckily, my parents had a large collection of books and encouraged reading. By the time I was twelve, I had read all of the Tolkien books, all of the Oz books, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Dune, and many more. In high school, when most of my peers were dreading Dickens and Dostoevsky and Woolf, I looked forward to A Tale of Two Cities, Crime and Punishment, and Mrs. Dalloway to name but a few.</p>
<p>Despite my early love of fiction, since math and science had always come naturally, nothing propelled me in the direction of writing. In college, engineering was an obvious choice for me, but I stuck with literature for my electives since reading and analyzing fictional worlds had always been my great escape. Faced with the drudgery of engineering labs, Maxwell’s Equation, and Laplace Transforms, I needed that fictional escape more than ever!</p>
<p>On a whim, I took two courses my Junior year that put me on Frost’s proverbial road less traveled. First, a Creative Writing course taught by the renowned poet, Archie Ammons. I’m still not sure what he saw in my poetry, but whatever it was he encouraged me to pursue a career in writing. At the time, I thought he was nuts, but he seemed sincere enough to give me an A+. Second, the Art of the Essay with Lydia Fakundiny, who remains, perhaps, the most articulate person I ever met. Her command of language was truly brilliant and inspiring. She opened up the writer’s toolbox in a way I had never before imagined possible. Like Ammons, she surprised me by encouraging me to stick with writing, as if it was something I was good at!</p>
<p>By the time I had taken these two seminal writing classes, however, it was too late to change majors (financially and practically). Writing, it seemed, would have to remain a dream. When I left college, I pursued what came naturally–technology–but never let the writing dream wither. For many years, I would wake up early or stay up late into the night, filling the nooks and crannies of my busy days with writing, some structured, most un-.</p>
<p>I have reams of lousy stories, essays, and poems to prove it, but those small daily efforts brought me closer to where I am today. A few years ago, I decided it was now or never, so I set my technology career aside and have been writing full time since. My publications include a volume of poetry, Outside the Box, and my first novel, Glide. I plan to publish a collection of short stories this spring and, hopefully, a sequel to Glide later this year. For me, becoming a writer is a dream come true.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical writing day?</p>
<p>Bill &#8211;</p>
<p>1) Wake up</p>
<p>2) Grab coffee</p>
<p>3) Kiss my son on the cheek and my wife, too, as she takes him off to school</p>
<p>4) Plant my butt in my office chair for a minimum of 4 hours, often more</p>
<p>5) Repeat, Monday through Friday, weekends if my loving family permits</p>
<p>lol! Sounds simple, but it’s not. After all these years, I’ve discovered that I write better in the morning, when I’m sufficiently caffeinated and energetic enough to grab my muse by the heels and pin her to a page. That’s on good days. On bad days, my muse eludes me as easily as Pan’s shadow and no matter which keys I press, &#8220;blah, blah, blah&#8221; appears on the screen. But as awful as the day’s work might seem, when I stick to the routine, I feel productive. Afternoons I save for marketing activities, catching up on emails, and hunting down answers to those persnickety research questions that come up during the morning.</p>
<p>Oh, and much to my family’s and friends’ chagrin, I carry a voice recorder everywhere I go. Since I’m not a genius who can pull unique and interesting thoughts out of thin air at will, I have to be ready when one hits me with bruising impact. My solution: Have Voice Recorder, Will Travel. In this day and age of smartphones, Facebook, and YouTube, I find it amusing that people get intimidated whenever I whip out my voice recorder–as if the ancient device holds some numinous power that might do them harm.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your book Glide deals with a category of fiction you call Green Sci-Fi. What does this involve?</p>
<p>Bill - I have always wondered at the plethora of dystopian novels and worlds anchoring our literature. It’s as if the facts on the ground are always so grim that it’s impossible for even our most brilliant writers and artists to imagine a road that leads anywhere but Armageddon. Bright, hopeful futures are relegated to Disneyesque animations, if they’re told at all. Of course, the facts on the ground ARE grim when it comes to matters of ecological stewardship, peace, and prosperity across our world. And, as the Prophet in Glide says about our politicians, “oil flows through their veins and gunpowder salts their meals.”</p>
<p>But it occurs to me that we can hardly ask corrupt politicians to set us on a more hopeful road if our artists and writers can’t even imagine one. Being an optimist by nature, I truly believe in humanity’s capacity to innovate ourselves out of the dark places our biology and self-interest often lead us. Green Sci Fi, then, is my attempt to bring to life (bring back to life?) a genre that focuses on a hopeful future. The backdrop of Star Trek, for example, is an Earth that has achieved a harmonious, healthy global society–one that enables and encourages space exploration. But just because the future is not dystopian does not mean it has to be utopian. After all, we migrate to horror, suspense, and tragedy because they trigger in us a kind of biochemical rush, which makes utopias boring and dystopias thrilling. Thus, Star Trek has its villains even if they are based in space.</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s my belief that we can set thrillers in a future world where science and good will have overcome TODAY’s challenges even as human nature threatens to undermine that future with its usual shortcomings. Green Sci Fi, then, is that future world where we have defied the odds and solved many of the worst problems of today even as tomorrow threatens us with its own new challenges.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think are the best ways a writer can promote themselves? i.e. Facebook, Twitter, advertising etc.</p>
<p>Bill - I’m still figuring this one out! Conventional wisdom says to a) have a unique platform; and b) get out and meet people and market your product. As for meeting people, a great way to get started is to sign up for readings at book stores, schools, wherever and whenever anyone will listen. I’m a believer in this tried and true form of promotion. Although I haven’t done as many readings as I should, whenever I leave a book reading and signing, I know I have that many more fans.</p>
<p>Face to face interaction really works, but it is time consuming and can be costly depending upon travel requirements. As far as promotion on online venues, my own experience has been that genre specific blogs–even if they are niche in nature and therefore cater to a small audience–are the online equivalent of pressing the flesh. You’re more likely to strike a chord with readers and garner new fans.</p>
<p>For me, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been necessary, but have such a high bounce rate, I don’t rely on them for direct promotion. I suppose they come in handy if your work truly “goes viral.” My own website seems to attract a small but steady flow of unique visitors, and tends to offer one of the stronger clickthru rates to online sales, but the jury is still out.</p>
<p>On the matter of platform, for fiction writers it can be tough to develop one unless you’re a long-time career person who’s turned to writing (Grisham-Legal Thrillers, le Carre-Spy Novels, etcetera). Still, it’s not impossible to develop a platform that’s unique to you and your work. In the end, I find that a platform helps to hone your message and does seem to make a difference. For my novel Glide, I’ve been promoting the idea of Green Sci Fi based on the novel’s themes, my interests, and some of my background. Again, the jury’s still out, but along the way I’ve garnered the interest of the Huffington Post and the NRDC who posted articles on Glide because of its Green Sci Fi angle.</p>
<p>Darrell - Glide has been featured on Wattpad. In what ways has this been successful for you?</p>
<p>Bill - From its management team and staff to its readers and subscribers, Wattpad has provided me with a rich, engaged community of people who clearly care about writing and reading. I can’t say that my experience with Wattpad has translated into gobs of sales, but it has translated into invaluable feedback for my work, thoughtful fans, and nearly a million reads of my novel Glide (and counting).</p>
<p>When discussing Wattpad, however, I have to call out one person in particular–Nina Lassam, Wattpad’s tireless, creative, and thoughtful Marketing Exec, who has helped me to navigate Wattpad and offered me the opportunity to promote myself outside of the Wattpad environment. Thanks Nina!</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the single, best thing a person can do to help the environment?</p>
<p>Bill - Love it. When you love something or someone, you want to spend time with them, appreciate them, enjoy their beauty, help them to thrive. If we impart the same kind of love and respect to the environment that we would to anyone who nurtured us, provided for us, and supported our own pursuit of happiness, in the long run the environment would love us back.</p>
<p>Sadly, from the Sahara to the Amazon, Arctic to Antarctic, examples abound of what happens when we abuse the environment and it begins to fail. There’s only a finite amount of Earth, and, as the Prophet tells the Captain in Glide when it comes to humanity and civilization: “If we believed in our own ingenuity and wisdom, truly believed in our ability to survive without consuming everything in our path, then we would be able to reject our primordial programming for what it is, evolutionary scrap. We would live in a more tolerant world…and that means we would take responsibility for our condition.”</p>

<p>Steven Savile &#8211; Dr Who &amp; Torchwood Writer Makes it Big on Kindle</p>
<p>Steven Savile has had an amazing career, writing tie-in novels for Dr Who and Torchwood as well as working as an editor and also writing original work. In this interview, Steven spoke about how he became a writer and the best ways for writers to make themselves known.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Steven - Oh goodness me, what a big question to start off with. Okay, basically I started out writing quite young, like most people, but didn’t get serious about it until my early 20s, in which case I was reliant upon friends and family putting up with my ‘madness’. My first sale came 19 years ago this month, actually, to Exuberance, a magazine in the UK. Paid fifty quid for a story ‘Coming For to Carry You Home’ as in Swing low, sweet chariot. It was a horror story, but with a hokey faux Stephen King style homely voice. I remember it getting a brilliantly awful review, something along the lines of take a dollop of Clive Barker, add in a soupcon of Stephen King, a dash of Graham Masterton and spice with a little Richard Laymon and you’ve got the recipe for Steve Savile’s story… brutal but quite true. Starting out it’s so hard to find your own voice and just be the best YOU you can be.</p>
<p>I then sold like wildfire, but you’d never believe it to see what actually appeared. I sold a novel to a publisher in the UK that never came out because of the paper price hike and the whole rainforest deforestation thing. I sold 4 stories, including a serialised 50,000 word story to Frighteners and Fear, our two big newsstand magazines. The day the first one, In Darkness, We Sleep, was due to appear the parent company Newsfield International went bust, so somewhere there was a warehouse with thirty thousand copies of my big break mouldering away…</p>
<p>Then I wrote a novel, Laughing Boy’s Shadow, which was bought by Tanjen, a small press in the UK that had bookstore distribution, who went bust before it came out. I sold it to Gargadillo in the US, who went bust before it came out. I sold it to Indigo in the US who went bust before it came out. I sold it to Dark Tales as a follow up to Secret Life of Colours, who went bust before it came out. I sold it Aleph in Sweden, making it’s first print appearance actually not in the English language. Subsequently I self-published 250 copies of it via my website and sold out in 2 weeks. That was back in 2001/2, so pretty much a decade ago. I recently sold it as a gorgeous limited edition hardcover/paperback in the US with Horror World, run by the fabulous Nanci Kalanta, who read the manuscript, cried, and two years later when she was setting up her small press asked me if she could do it. It’s probably my most treasured possession. I love what she did with it. This month I retitled it Outcasts and put it up on the kindle in the UK/US at a bargain 99c/70p because it’s a book I really do love and it feels like the little story that could…</p>
<p>During lots of ups and downs I made friends with a tremendously talented writer, Steve Bowkett, who happened to make note that his publishers, Hendersons, were looking for writers to work on a teen horror line. So I phoned up the editor on his recommendation, we chatted and she said ‘Ah, you sound fab, but we’re full on the horror… do you think you could write a pre-teen romance?’ so… I obviously said ‘I can do that!’ and was greeted by ‘great, we need the outline on our desks by 5pm tomorrow because we’re commissioning now.’ I took the then girlfriend and all of her friends out for a beer or three and asked them a gazillion questions about what they thought was ‘hot romance’ when they were 11-12 and came up with a pitch. Delivered it via fax from the local post office at 4:55 the next day and got a phone call at 5:30 saying ‘this is brilliant. We love love love it… but it’s too much like Steve Bowkett’s story, can you give us another idea for tomorrow morning?’ so I did… and they loved it. But the series was dropped before the books came out. However, it established a good working relationship with the editor, who then hired me to write a kid’s guide to the internet in 1995 (pre-explorer/netscape stuff) that never came out, and then hired me to write my first two published books, a kid’s adaptation of Return of the Jedi and a Jurassic Park II: Lost World data file. So in 1997 I was all set to be a kids writer.</p>
<p>The big change in fortune came around 2001 when I won the Writers of the Future award for Bury my Heart at the Garrick, a fantasy version of the last week of Houdini’s life.</p>
<p>That led to this. I’ve worked in lots of different franchises now, things like Dr Who, Stargate, Primeval, Torchwood, Warhammer, Slaine, all things I either loved as a kid, or came to love as an adult… and on the side continued to write my original stuff, culminating in Silver, which came out in hardcover last year, and Immortal, which is due any day now…</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve previously written for Dr Who, Torchwood, Primeval and other TV series. How has writing for TV influenced the way you write your novels?</p>
<p>Steven - Probably the biggest thing is character and understanding how important the people are in a story, then it’s forced me to listen and listen hard. As a writer doing tv stuff your characters need to SOUND and ACT just as they would in the shows. You need to sound like John Barrowman or Dougie Henshall when you’re writing a line for Captain Jack or Professor Cutter. It then becomes very useful when writing your own stuff because you get how the nuances of character work so much better than before. I’m a better writer now for all the tie-in stuff I’ve done. Of course you also start to think in terms of cycles not acts - a tv show has a fairly standard set-up, cliffhanger, fail, victory cycle… like those old Dr Who episodes from the classic series used to have (and then broadcast on four evenings a week so you’d keep coming back night after night…)</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you break into writing TV tie-in books - and is it a profitable course for authors to take?</p>
<p>Steven - That’s another one of those long stories short things, I had done a few Warhammer bits and bobs, and found some of the Big Finish Dr Who books in a Waterstones in Nottingham. I had no idea that new adventures were going on (and it was pre new WHO) so I dropped them an email and Ian Farrington was in the process of editing The Centenarian. He offered me a slot for a short story and it took me quite literally forever to do Falling From Xian because I was obsessed with it being ‘Dr Who’ and not wanting to screw it up… from there I basically bartered one job for another, approaching publishers with ‘Hi, I’ve written x, y and z and would love to work with you!’ It worked.</p>
<p>In terms of profitable, tie-ins are a mixed bag. Many outsell traditional fantasy/sf novels probably 10-1 but they’re selling the franchise not the writer so a lot of the audience won’t follow from one series to another. I joke about being the most famous author you’ve never heard of… I wouldn’t advise it to the majority of new writers though, it can be soul destroying watching the stuff you’re most proud of being culled from the work because it’s not ‘x’ series… and fans of certain shows are rabid. They all have their own versions of how that world really is and if you don’t match their expectations they’ll merrily crucify you for it. I enjoy it though. I enjoy the challenge of working in other people’s sandboxes and playing with their toys.</p>
<p>Darrell - “Silver” is currently in the top 100 Bestselling Kindle books. How did you achieve such a fantastic accomplishment?</p>
<p>Steven - It’s been top 20 for about 2 months now. I can’t really take any credit for it. I’ve only just updated my website (<a href="http://www.stevensavile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.stevensavile.com</a>) for the first time in 8 months. It was 17 months before that for the previous update. I’ve added a newsletter function and a blog and am trying to be much more conscious of connecting with readers than I have been before. With Silver the only real piece of ‘cleverness’ in terms of the UK ebook was that I wrote a self-contained story featuring Noah Larkin, one of the characters, and offered it for free - all people had to do was email in to get it. I had a few hundred people do just that. Then once I was ready to do the UK ebook I sent a single email to these guys and said ‘you might like to know…’ it was just enough to break the top 100 thrillers… but the success came from the book itself and word of mouth and all those good old fashioned things writers have no control over. I just wrote what I think/hope was a good book.</p>
<p>Of course, when it first came out in the US I did the blog tours and signings and such, but that effort seemed to have minimal effect, so I work on the logic that the best promotion for your book is another book… and keep on writing.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think are the best ways for writers to market themselves i.e. Facebook, Twitter, book signings etc?</p>
<p>Steven - See above. I really don’t know. Just be yourself. Write good books. Be the best you can be. I have Facebook but I use it mainly to chat with friends. I think Twitter’s worthless. Book signings you are generally meeting people who would already/usually buy your book so you’re not reaching new readers… so the long and the short of it is I don’t know. You just have to find what you are comfortable with and what expresses your personality best. It should be different for everyone. I just shiver when I see some stuff though. Be classy.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you give to someone about to self publish their first ebook?</p>
<p>Steven - Right now we’re looking at a fairly level playing field, I think. For once you have a chance of finding an audience for your work without being dependent upon the old structures. While Amazon are playing nice you want to look at establishing some shelf-space. You need to be professional about it though. Think of yourself as a brand. I know it’s a dirty word for creatives, but if you look at my website, you look at the blog, the newsletter, the book covers, there’s a very definite visual theme running through all of this stuff, so you can look and go ‘ah that’s by the guy who did Silver…’ it creates brand identity and faith in that brand. If you enjoyed Silver the odds are you’ll enjoy Immortal, and Outcasts… that’s what the visuals are saying. Think long and hard about pricing. I went low. A lot of colleagues claim that by doing so I devalued my brand - but it was a deliberate move. I priced it in impulse price territory where even if you don’t like it you’re unlikely to feel that you wasted your 70p. I make 21p a copy sold. On my latest paperback in the UK I make about 50p a copy sold… so I need to sell 2-1 on the ebooks basically to bring home the same income. I could price it at 1.49 and bring in a quid, doubling the royalty on normal paperback, but right now people in the UK are still new to the kindle and are shopping for bargains. The sweet point on prices will rise, I’m fairly sure, but today, low=attractive.</p>

<p>Adam Wallace &#8211; How to Write Children&#8217;s Books &#8211; that sell!</p>
<p>Adam Wallace has successfully carved himself a niche in the world of children&#8217;s writing. He has had several books published including The Negatees, The Share-A-Not and Better Out Than In. He has also self published a number of books, proving that writers can both work with publishers and issue their own work as well.</p>
<p>In this interview he spoke about children&#8217;s writing and writing books for kids that sell.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you break into the world of children’s writing?</p>
<p>Adam - I don’t know about break, it was more a slow erosion! After some Troubles in Year 12, I stopped writing for around 10 years. It was a very mature and sophisticated response to those troubles &#8230; then I started writing again after a bet with my wife (she bet I could write a kid’s book, I bet I couldn’t!). From that moment on I was hooked. I wrote constantly (and still do!) and I would read my work to all and any children I could, to get a grip on what was working and what wasn’t. In terms of actual books, I broke in by self-publishing (five years after starting to write, and also after 150 or so rejections!). I still self-publish some of my books to this day.</p>
<p>Darrell - In what ways do you think writing for children is more difficult and less difficult than writing for adults?</p>
<p>Adam - To be honest, I have never tried writing for adults, so I can’t really compare. One way writing for children is difficult though, especially for picture books, is the length and tightness required. I tend to babble (as you may find out with some of these answers!), so getting a whole story done in around 500 words isn’t an easy thing for me. Another difficulty, for me, is writing for pictures, if that makes sense. So much of what is written can be said through the illustrations so, in other words, it doesn’t need to be written at all! This is not always an easy thing to get your head around if you can&#8217;t imagine what the pictures may be. In terms of easiness, if that’s a word, I tend to relate really well to kids, so writing for them is extremely natural for me. I think that is really important, finding the age group, whether it be children or young adults or adults, that you feel most comfortable writing for. Your writing will then be that much more honest and that much more real.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think a writer needs to consider before writing a children’s book? e.g. age specific, language etc.</p>
<p>Adam - This is a tricky one to answer, as I am very much a stream of consciousness writer, so I tend to write the book first and then work out who it’s for afterwards (it has always been for kids so far though)! So I will read through a story after I&#8217;ve churned it out and realise it was written for younger kids, or upper primary or whatever. I have written some books with a certain age group in mind, but even then it was more ‘Primary school&#8217; age or ‘kids who like Dr Seuss&#8217; age. But the language side of it is definitely important. Kids don’t like to be talked down to, and can spot it easily.</p>
<p>I think that if you are honest in your writing, and enthusiastic for your writing, that will shine through in the finished work. But speaking to kids of the age you would like to write for, reading books for kids of that age, watching TV shows for that age group, all of that helps with defining an age group&#8217;s language immensely. Length is also important, as obviously very young children can&#8217;t last for long books, and older children usually aren&#8217;t interested in a short &#8216;baby&#8217; book. This sort of thing is often specified in publisher guidelines, so these are always good to look at to get an idea of how long a story for a certain age group should be. In saying that, however, there can always be exceptions to the rules. Dr Seuss wrote some long books for younger kids, and they tend to go okay.</p>
<p>Darrell - The artist you’ve used for a number of your books is Heath McKenzie. How did you end up working with Heath?</p>
<p>Adam - Heath and I have done 5 books together now, and I thank my lucky stars for it every day. I think he’s a genius. We started off working together back in 2004 when I self-published my first book, Better Out Than In. I found Heath on the internet, through <a href="http://www.thestylefile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.thestylefile.com</a> His work stood out to me by a mile, so I contacted him and he was keen to have a crack at drawing some nice gross pictures for me! We were both starting out at the time so it worked out well.</p>
<p>When JoJo Publishing picked up my books, I was lucky enough for them to ask if I had any illustrators in mind for the books (apparently this is not a common question authors are asked!). I showed them Heath’s work, they were rapt and immediately decided to redo Better Out Than In in a new edition, and then use Heath in my next three books as well!</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way a writer can market themselves?</p>
<p>Adam - Hmmm, well, being a bit of a marketing gumby, the best thing I have done for myself is to get myself and my books out there in person. Markets have been brilliant for me, both in terms of sales and also in terms of meeting people. I have met teachers, which has led to school visits, I have met librarians, and I have met people from different associations, other countries, it’s brilliant. And, of course, I have even met people who run websites that do interviews with authors! That&#8217;s the thing with putting yourself out there in some way. You never know who you are going to meet that could take your books to the next level.</p>
<p>I think marketing books has been, for me, a combination of being myself but also getting out of my comfort zone. It is also a constant learning experience. There are so many more options now, with the internet and blogs and Facebook and Twitter. The thing is, you have to find what works for you, and it may be different for all writers. But, in the end, it is all about getting yourself and your books out there and getting known. That is the most important thing of all, however you do it. Whether it be face to face or online, if people don&#8217;t know about your books they aren&#8217;t going to go searching for them in bookstores.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you see the future of books now that eBooks are becoming more common?</p>
<p>Adam - I am on the side of hardcopy books. I do like using technology, don’t get me wrong, but I absolutely love having a real book in my hands. There’s something different and tactile and magical about it. There&#8217;s even a smell about an actual book that brings forth feelings and memories. This is especially so with children and children&#8217;s books. I can&#8217;t imagine snuggling up on a couch, or on a bed, and pulling out an iPad to read a story with your child. Sorry, but for me that takes the romanticism and the joy out of it all. And then there are the tactile books. Books that have touch and feel, helping children learn smooth and rough and furry, lessons they can transfer into the real world. &#8220;That&#8217;s just like in the book!&#8221; is an exciting thing to hear as a child picks up an object or strokes an animal. There are also books where there are tabs with hidden gems underneath. Sure, these can be replicated in an eBook, but for me it&#8217;s great for children to actually be able to lift up a flap rather than slide their finger on a screen. And I love hearing about children that run to a bookshelf and pull out their favourite book over and over again. I just can&#8217;t see swiping through an e-reader to look for the favourite book bringing the same joy to the child or parent.</p>
<p>I believe (and hope and cross my fingers) that there are enough people like me out in the world so that books will never disappear. I actually think that books and eBooks can work side-by-side, to use a slogan from a great football team. I also think it&#8217;s amazing seeing children learn how to use computers and iPads, and seeing how quickly they pick things up. There are positives and negatives for each format but, in the end, if people are loving reading maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter how they are doing it. I still like books though!</p>

<p>Dale Brown &#8211; Taking Flight with a Bestselling Author</p>
<p>Dale Brown has had thirteen New York Times bestsellers to his name.</p>
<p>His books are easily identifiable. They are those aviation techno-thriller novels you see at the bookshop. His books have been published in 11 languages and distributed to over 70 countries. In all, over 10 million copies of his books, audio books and computer games have been produced.</p>
<p>In recent years he has expanded his writing and works with another author, Jim DeFelice, to continue his bestselling crusade. In this interview, Dale spoke about, not just writing that novel you&#8217;ve always wanted to write, but the importance of always planning and thinking about the next book. And the next.</p>
<p>Darrell - You have been writing from a young age. Can you describe how you went from a ‘part time’ writer to creating your first successful novel?</p>
<p>Dale - I have wanted to write since I was in middle school. I’m not sure where the urge to write fiction came from, because I always wanted to write non-fiction. (computer reviews, military base articles, etc.) I had a column in the college newspaper at Penn State and wrote computer software and hardware reviews for several magazines. I started writing columns at Penn State when I wrote a critical opinion to another columnist and the editor asked me “Do you think you can do better?” I said “Yes” and I wrote for two years at PSU at the Daily Collegian.</p>
<p>I started writing “Flight of the Old Dog” in 1983 when I was flying B-52Gs in the Air Force and I really enjoyed the freedom and creative range with fiction. My focus always was writing real-world events in a fictional setting.</p>
<p>I was always amazed when I wrote articles about military flying exercises we’d do and folks on the military bases had no idea what we’d do. Dozens of aircraft would leave the base in the middle of the night and no one had any idea what they were doing until I described it. I knew that’s what I wanted to write about.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Dale - A typical day of writing is sitting down at the desk and reading, re-writing, and writing. I try to make myself available for my son when he’s out of school but otherwise I’m at the desk working. Being a writer is a rather boring job: your job is to sit at the desk and create. Your life exists in the universe between your ears. That’s what your fans want to experience. Your job is to translate the world you create into words that others can experience.</p>
<p>Darrell - Airplanes are obviously your first love and many of your earlier books feature your hero Patrick McLanahan. Some of your more recent books seem to be more ‘land based’ than ‘air based’. Is there any particular reason for this?</p>
<p>Dale - Patrick has been around for a number of years and even die-hard fans might be getting a little tired of him. My job is to create a new evolving universe with new characters and new plots that expand and enhance the universe I’ve already created. I’ll always be air-power-centric but I’ll explore and enhance new technology to stay on the cutting edge. Patrick is the centre of my universe but others are stepping up to take centre stage, like Patrick’s son Bradley.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve teamed up with Jim DeFelice to co-author a number of books. What’s it like working with another author and how does this work in practical terms?</p>
<p>Dale - Jim DeFelice is an incredible writing and idea machine.  He’s taken my ideas and plots and taken them to extraordinary dimensions. I’m fortunate to be linking up with an incredible talent like Jim DeFelice and I hope to continue working with him for years to come.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think are the best ways a writer can market themselves?</p>
<p>Dale - Always operate outside your comfort zone. You have a novel ready for publication?–you should be in the bookstores EVERY DAY pushing your work. You should be on a lecture circuit, volunteering your time to speak in front of groups. Writing the book is one important phase, but MARKETING your book is the next important phase, and it’s just as important as the writing part. Get out in front of the booksellers, social groups, organizations, etc. Are you shy? BREAK OUT. Learn about Twitter and Facebook and BE ACTIVE. Be proactive.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to get their first book published?</p>
<p>Dale - Be persistent. Be active. Writing your book is the most important ingredient, but GETTING IT SOLD is the second most important part, and it takes as much effort as writing. DON’T QUIT. Be positive. If you get negative feedback on you work, evaluate and act on it. SELL YOURSELF. Publishers buy IDEAS and PLOTS, so if you have a story to tell, SELL IT. NEVER GIVE UP. I have a scrapbook with over a HUNDRED rejection letters for “Flight of the Old Dog,” and that’s just the ones that answered back. DON’T QUIT. If you get a rejection, analyse it and apply it to your story, but DON’T STOP PITCHING. NEVER QUIT.</p>
<p>Beyond that: start working on the NEXT book. Publishers like authors that have lots of books in them. You want to be a writer–you better have lots of books in your belly ready to be released. Get busy. You want to be a writer–WRITE!</p>

<p>Stephanie McAfee &#8211; Ebook sales Leads to Three Book Publishing Deal</p>
<p>A little while ago Stephanie McAfee had a half finished book and a dream. A few months later, her book was completed and she had signed up for a three book publishing deal with a major American company. Her first book is &#8220;Diary of a Mad Fat Girl&#8221; and it has already sold many thousands of ebook copies.</p>
<p>She recently revised and expanded the book and it now features an exciting new cover.</p>
<p>How did all this happen? This is how.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where did you get the idea for your book “Diary of a Mad Fat Girl”?</p>
<p>Stephanie - It came in pieces, actually, one character at a time. I was having a “wouldn’t it be funny if….” moment when I came up with Ace Jones back in 2005. I created most of the characters and several of the scenes in ‘05 and ‘06, then put it all aside until last year when I opened that old word doc and got to work.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Stephanie - I wrote this book around my son’s sleeping schedule. Sometimes I would get up early, sometimes I would stay up late, but most of the work was done during his afternoon nap. Now, however, I have a much better situation. I get up early and head to the library at the University of West Florida where I set up shop at a secluded cubby desk situated between some rarely used book stacks. It’s total silence and I love it.</p>
<p>Darrell - You self published the book on Amazon in December of last year and you have now received a 3 book deal with New American Library. Can you describe the events that led to this wonderful event?</p>
<p>Stephanie - I got serious about writing Diary in March of last year. Sometime in October, I noticed that a Kindle ad was on the back of almost every magazine in print and was obviously being marketed as the Big Christmas Gift of 2010. I did a little research and when I found out that it cost absolutely nothing to list a book for sale on Amazon, I stopped wasting time on query letters (all of which always got rejected anyway) and shifted my focus to completing the book. I wanted to be finished by Thanksgiving, but that didn’t happen and I had to rush to get it done by December 25.</p>
<p>It sold nine copies that first week and I was beside myself. In January, it sold 1991 copies. I could not believe how well it was doing, so on February 4, I listed it with Barnes &amp; Noble. Things really took off at Amazon in February, then Barnes &amp; Noble caught on in March, and no one was more surprised than me when it found its way onto the New York Times Bestsellers List. Rick Wales  (&lt;<a href="http://squidoo.com/MobyD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://squidoo.com/MobyD</a>&gt;) was kind enough to post that news on Diary’s facebook page March 18 and that’s actually how I found out. As you might imagine, that’s when things really got interesting. I accepted an offer of representation from LJK Literary Management on March 28 and now I’m working with Danielle Perez at NAL and looking forward to a release in Feb, 2012. It’s been an amazing experience and there are still times when I stop and think, “I cannot believe this.”</p>
<p>Darrell - The book has been priced in that .99 cent zone. How important has that  been to sales and to everything that has followed?</p>
<p>Stephanie - I am certain that was a major factor in my success.</p>
<p>Darrell - How have you gone about marketing yourself?</p>
<p>Stephanie - I created a blog, after which I discovered that most writers create a blog, then write a book, so I guess I got that one backward. I also created a Facebook “like” page that I linked to my product pages on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble and that worked like a charm. I also created a Twitter account and though I’m far from being Twitteriffic, I have managed to post a few tweets @stephaniemcafee. My most recent endeavour has been to unleash Ace Jones on Twitter at @Mad_Fat_Girl. That has definitely been the most fun.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone about to self publish their own book?</p>
<p>Stephanie - 1) Take your time and make sure you have everything just like you want it. 2) Have your manuscript professionally edited by someone with good credentials and a good reputation. 3) Sell it for 99 cents. 4) Have a little faith in yourself. Had someone told me this time last year that this is where I’d be today, I would’ve laughed in their face. But here I am. In a total state of disbelief. :)</p>

<p>Jeff Bennington &#8211; Goodreads, Kindlenation and Blog Tour Promotion</p>
<p>Jeff Bennington is an author residing in Central Indiana. He has had many occupations over the years including working on an assembly line, teaching Sunday school and installing HVAC units. He has also run his own business.</p>
<p>An occasional runner and a lifelong drummer, he has continued to write and is now the author of Reunion, an Amazon Bestseller, Twisted Vengeance and Creepy: A collection of scary stories.</p>
<p>Jeff Blogs weekly at <a href="http://www.thewritingbomb.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Writing Bomb</a>, is the founder of <a href="http://thekindlebookreview.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Kindle Book Review </a>and is also the author of the recently released, The Indie Author’s Guide to the Universe. In this interview, Jeff spoke about how he became a writer and some of the ways that writers can promote themselves.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you become a writer?</p>
<p>Jeff - Time. Life happened for thirty-five years. When I finally decided to do something I enjoyed and that I was good at, writing was at the top of the list. For once, a career decision had nothing to do with money, security or benefits. Writing, to my way of thinking, has nothing to do with ‘want’. It’s all about ‘have to’. Once you start, you can’t stop because it’s an addiction. I’ve written 4 1/2 novels, 1 non-fiction and 1 short story since 2007 and I’m just getting started.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Jeff - Sure. I wake up around noon, write about an hour, go for a walk, shower, have coffee, meet my buddies for a round of golf. Then I come home, write another hour or two and then go out drinking the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Do you believe that? I hope not.</p>
<p>I do write at night though. I work a fireman type schedule, long hours but fewer days. When I’m not working, I’ll get in anywhere from 500-2000 words a night unless I’m editing. I write late into morning and listen to rock music, AC/DC, Journey, Dave Mathews Band or a sampling of a thunderstorm, depending on my mood. We also homeschool our four children, so when I’m not writing, we’re pretty busy educating those little zombies!</p>
<p>Darrell - You wrote a couple of novels prior to REUNION. What was wrong with those first attempts that made you say, “I’m not ready yet”?</p>
<p>Jeff - Well, I didn’t actually say that. I thought I was ready but in truth, I wasn’t. And that’s a common mistake for folks who decide, “I’m going to write a book.” What they should say is, “I should figure out what it takes to write a book well.”</p>
<p>I jumped in sight unseen, and as one of my early reviewers of Killing the Giants so boldly said, “POOR WRITING SKILLS!” The reviewer didn’t exactly say it with caps and an exclamation point, but that’s how it feels when the stark reality of where you are as an author smacks you in the face. Those were the most valuable words anyone could have said to me. They hurt, but they changed me. Those words turned me around and caused me to start a serious study of the craft that I still continue today. In fact, I’m currently reading, The Break Out Novel by Donald Maass, and On Writing Horror by The Horror Writer’s Association simultaneously while editing my latest work, Twisted Vengeance.</p>
<p>Darrell - I know you’ve been on a “Blog Tour”. How did you arrange this and was it successful for promoting your work?</p>
<p>Jeff - Ah, the question bloggers are asking me left and right. How I arranged it will take up too much time. It was a huge undertaking that absorbed about 140 hours of my time. If you want to know if it was successful, the short answer is “Yes. I think so.” The long answer is an entirely seperate blog post. I’ve written an article about my 45-day blog tour and it is currently posted at two blogs and scheduled to post at three other blogs soon. And that demonstrates the power of a blog tour and how it can build your platform and credibility as an author. The fact that you contacted me for an interview is further evidence of the power of blog touring.</p>
<p>Did the blog tour promote my work? Yes. But those numbers are hard to measure because REUNION has been added to many reader’s “To be read lists” which will bring sales in time, not necessarily immediately. I’ll put it this way, I sold 500 copies of Killing the Giants between 2009 and 2011 without any idea what I was doing. I published REUNION on April 15 of 2011 and I’ve already sold more than that with continued sales ranging from 1-10 everyday, which isn’t a huge deal, but it’s far better than my previous results. Until I built my blog tour, I had very little platform and I didn’t know any book bloggers or reviewers. That has all changed.</p>
<p>[Nine months later, Reunion hit #55 in Amazon’s US Top 100 and #16 in Amazon’s UK Top 100. His other titles, Creepy and Twisted Vengeance have also made it into Amazon category best seller lists and are holding their ground.]</p>
<p>Darrell - What other ways can writers best promote themselves?</p>
<p>Jeff - From my experience, there are a few good ways to promote your book. However, every author has to approach this differently based on their genre and subject matter. The best promotion for me has come from the following:</p>
<p>#1 Goodreads.com: Goodreads “giveaways” are an incredible tool to publicize your book. I also like what my ad on Goodreads is doing. The thing with Goodreads is not how many clicks or sales you get, but how many folks “add” your book. When they do that, they are more or less planning on buying your book when they get to it, and they will, because most readers on Goodreads are avid readers and love talking about what they read, so they will also rate and review your book, which is another benefit of that site. Right now, Goodreads isn’t doing anything for me.</p>
<p>#2 Blog: If you don’t have a blog or you’re afraid of starting one or you think it’s too much work, then plan on writing your book soley for your mother to enjoy because blogging is only the beginning of what it takes to market your book…and it’s the easiest. It’ll only get harder and more expensive from there. My blog has by far been my greatest tool for growing my audience and author circle.</p>
<p>#3 Kindlenation.com: This is a very good site but you’ll have to plan months in advance to run an ad, although it will definitely make your money back and more because they have a lot of readers who buy what they advertise. Programs run from $119 to $349. Reaches from 7,500 to 15,000 opt-in readers.</p>
<p>#4 Twitter, Facebook, email lists; These are the most obvious and basic starting points. I’ll put it this way, I got all 4 of my book blurbs through Twitter connections, two of which are bestselling authors. If you can get that elsewhere, go for it. Basically, you have to tell your social marketing pals about your book. And…you have to share their work. If you blast your friends and followers with your personal spam, they will retweet and share less and less. Share what they are doing and chat with them and you’ll notice a marked difference in how receptive they are to spreading the word about your work. I’ve experimented with this and I can tell you without a shadow of doubt that cross promotion helps.</p>
<p>#5 DigitalBookToday.com: is a great site for free and paid promotion, but I’ve heard that Ereaderdaily.com is a good sight to advertise on. This program is $25 a day. Emails will reach about 10,000 book readers who have opted in.</p>
<p>#6 Blog Tour: Plan for a lot of work. It can be nearly free, but will be the most time consuming. However, if your book sucks, I think a blog tour can backfire. I’m just sayin’. If you go this route, you better get your book professionally edited and proofed and have a great cover and good formatting because that’s what book bloggers and reviewers expect.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the “secret of success” for someone trying to succeed as an author?</p>
<p>Jeff - That’s easy. Endurance. Practice. Study. Practice. Relationships. Practice. Time. Books. Shelf space. Practice. Thick skin. Humility. Desire. Practice.</p>
<p>The truth is, writing is not what beginners think. It’s very hard! If you want to be a successful writer, as if I am, you can’t be anything else. You might have a job. You might have children. You might work as an orthodontist. But if you want to be a successful writer, you have to /be/ a writer. That will become your identity. You will read to be a better writer. You will write to perfect your craft. You will talk about writing. And you will blog about it. It will consume you like a wave swelling, foaming at the breaking point, devouring you. And when the waters rain over you and wash you to shore, sand in your shorts and all, you’ll know that you are a writer.</p>

<p>Michael Robotham &#8211; Ray Bradbury and Empty Cradles led to Writing Success</p>
<p>It has been said there are as many ways to become a writer as there are writers. Michael Robotham is an internationally successful crime writer, but some of his earliest writing was as a ghostwriter. His first ghostwritten work was &#8220;Empty Cradles&#8221;, a book which recently received renewed publicity because it has just been made into the movie &#8220;Oranges and Sunshine&#8221; starring Emily Watson, David Wenham and Hugo Weaving.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you become a writer?</p>
<p>Michael - When I was very young, I lived in small country towns in Australia and went to a little Catholic primary school. I used to sneak into the back storeroom and steal those small green-covered exercise books and imagine I was going to write something amazing.</p>
<p>The blank page kept me spellbound. Of course, I was never happy with the words I wrote. I felt as though I had spoiled the pages. I would have to start again.</p>
<p>When I was in my mid-teens I devoured Ray Bradbury&#8217;s novels and short story collections &#173;books like FAHRENHEIT 451 and THE ILLUSTRATED MAN. Not all of his titles were available in Australia, so I wrote a letter addressed to a publishing house in the US. Months later a parcel arrived in the post. It contained all the books that I hadn&#8217;t been able to get in Australia, as well as a handwritten letter from Bradbury himself, saying how thrilled he was to have a young fan on the far side of the world.</p>
<p>I became a writer because of Ray Bradbury.</p>
<p>Darrell - I understand you’ve ghostwritten some autobiographies for some very well known people. How did you get into that line of work?</p>
<p>Michael - I was working as a feature writer for The Mail on Sunday newspaper in the UK when I met and commissioned someone to write a piece and discovered that he was a ghostwriter. I was fascinated with the process that he went through and how he captured the voice of a subject.</p>
<p>Through him I met a literary agent and mentioned that I was interested in ghosting. It wasn&#8217;t until I quit journalism that I had the time to accept any projects. And those early books weren&#8217;t for big names. Unknown ghostwriters don&#8217;t get offered big books. You have to gain a reputation by tackling smaller projects and doing them well.</p>
<p>My first book was Empty Cradles by Margaret Humphries the story of how she uncovered the child migrant scandal. It has just been made into a film called Oranges and Sunshine.</p>
<p>Darrell - I believe you write about 500-1000 words a day. Do you ever get writer’s block or do you just ‘power’ through?</p>
<p>Michael - I don&#8217;t plot my books in advance, which makes the writing process very organic and exciting, but also quite scary. It&#8217;s like being an acrobat on a hire wire, working without a net. Sometimes this means I make mistakes. In the past I&#8217;ve had to ditch novels after 30,000 words because I wrote myself off a cliff and couldn&#8217;t see a way back.</p>
<p>As for writer&#8217;s block there are days when writing seems very easy and flows. Others it is like wading through treacle and every sentence is a chore. On the very worst days when you realise that you have to ditch weeks of work it is a terrible feeling. Imagine a computer crashing and wiping out an assignment then multiply this by ten or a hundred.</p>
<p>Darrell - What is the best way for a writer to market themselves i.e. Facebook, signings at bookshops etc?</p>
<p>Michael - The best way for a writer to market himself or herself is to write the best damn book possible. Write your socks off and then find an agent, who will hopefully find a publisher and so on. I see too many writers, who spend too much time worrying about marketing and not enough time writing.</p>
<p>Marketing is important, of course. I have a website and a Facebook page and I try to keep readers up to date on where I&#8217;m appearing and when books are coming out. Some writers are very successful bloggers but I feel as though I&#8217;ve got nothing to blog about unless I have a new book in the offing.</p>
<p>My most successful marketing tool has been appearances. I have always done a lot of travelling, giving talks in libraries and book shops. Through journalism and ghostwriting I have a wealth of funny anecdotes and stories I can tell. I don&#8217;t sell my books, I sell myself. If people have been entertained and intrigued if they&#8217;ve made a personal connection they&#8217;re more likely to pick up the book.</p>
<p>Darrell - You started out in the era of printed books, but you seem to have embraced Kindle ebooks with no problem. In what way has this been a successful move for you?</p>
<p>Michael - I don&#8217;t know if I would say that I&#8217;ve embraced Kindle. It&#8217;s simply another format just like hardback, paperback and audio books. With more and more people buying e-readers and purchasing their books digitally, it is a commercial imperative to cater for them.</p>
<p>I do feel sorry, however, when I imagine the next generation of writers who may never hold a physical version of their book in their hands or see it on the shelves of a bookshop.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for a writer about to publish their first novel?</p>
<p>Michael - Finish your second one.</p>
<p>You may be one of those very lucky writers, a shooting star that blazes a trail with your debut. More realistically, you should hope to sell a reasonable number, impressing your publisher on the upside. Work hard on marketing and promoting, but not to the detriment of the writing. Show your publishers that you&#8217;re in this for the long haul. You&#8217;re not just a one-book wonder. You&#8217;re a career writer. A professional.</p>

<p>Jennifer Bacia &#8211; Making her Own Luck</p>
<p>Jennifer Bacia is a writer who may have had a lucky break, but she has leveraged off that break to build a successful writing career. The author of ten books, she has had two of her novels optioned for films.</p>
<p>Her books are available at Smashwords and Amazon and have just been released with sizzling new covers.</p>
<p>Darrell - I know you were fortunate enough to meet Colleen McCullough early in your career. Do you think luck plays a role in succeeding as a writer?</p>
<p>Jennifer - Of course luck plays a certain part in success. I was lucky that Colleen McCullough gave me the name of my agent who was just setting up Australia’s first purely commercial fiction agency. She was looking for a female commercial writer and my first novel, ‘Shadows of Power’ was a hit for us both.  After that another 9 books followed with foreign translations, Book Club Choice novels, extracts in women’s magazines and options for TV rights.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Jennifer - A typical writing day: Good breakfast, read the Sydney Morning Herald cover to cover (minus sport!) tidy up. Begin by reading previous day’s work and editing. I always keep ‘polishing’ so that my first draft is pretty close to the final draft. I usually have a short break for lunch then work through till dog walking time in the late afternoon. Any form of exercise is a good way of clearing the mind. If I have deadlines, I will then work after dinner through till whenever exhaustion catches up with me. The ‘creative coma’ means that time has no meaning as the joy of the process takes over.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you believe your work is plot or character driven?</p>
<p>Jennifer - I think the best popular fiction is where both plot and character are driving the story. Sometimes one or the other dominates through the story but both are essential for a satisfying narrative.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you get your ideas and inspiration?</p>
<p>Jennifer - My ideas and inspirations usually emerge from what I am interested in -politics, current events, psychology, heritage, female independence, pressure points between men and women. The trick is to transform these interests into gripping stories that will reach a wide audience. I am an avid reader of newspapers and follow current events closely and have found triggers for many of my storylines this way.</p>
<p>Darrell - There is sometimes a stigma attached to popular fiction as opposed to so-called literary fiction. What are your feelings on that?</p>
<p>Jennifer - It’s an interesting question about the ‘stigma’ attached to popular fiction as opposed to literary fiction.  That stigma is probably most obvious when popular fiction is ‘reviewed’ by literary reviewers. Readers certainly don’t feel any stigma. I remember that my publishers didn’t want me to breathe a word to the media about the record breaking advance that I was receiving for my first and second novels. That wouldn’t happen nowadays I’m sure where every angle for publicity is explored. But perhaps back then it was to avoid upsetting literary writers who received such poor advances!</p>
<p>I’d like to think that e-printing will be a way of offering all writers their best chance of reaching as wide an audience as possible without the need to depend on publishers and their marketing and distribution departments, or uninterested, inexperienced bookstore staff.</p>
<p>Darrell - What would be the main advice you would give to new writers?</p>
<p>Jennifer - New writers need persistence and a deep well of self-belief to complete a novel.  When I see all the creative writing courses being run today I sometimes wonder how many of them are being taught by actual published authors. I also think many would-be writers have unrealistic expectations about the financial rewards of writing. That said, if you are convinced of your talent and find joy in the creative process then nothing will stop you from writing.</p>

<p>Christopher Buecheler &#8211; 70,000 Downloads of his Ebook and Counting</p>
<p>How would you feel if you wrote a book and it was downloaded over 70,000 times by readers? Probably pretty chuffed, I would imagine. Well, that&#8217;s exactly what has happened to Christopher Buecheler and his book &#8220;The Blood that Bonds&#8221;.</p>
<p>When I conducted this interview, Chris had not made a cent from all those downloads. Instead, he was setting up a firm foundation for his future writing career.</p>
<p>Darrell - When did you decide you wanted to become a writer and how did it happen?</p>
<p>Christopher - I don&#8217;t know that I can point to an exact moment where I made the decision to become a writer. It was more of an evolutionary process. Probably the most significant individual event was receiving my first PC for my birthday in 1986, when I turned nine. It came with a rudimentary word-processing program, and being able to type my ideas instead of having to hand-write them definitely had a major impact on me. By the time I was eleven, I had written a bunch of short stories (all terrible), and was beginning to be comfortable with longer work. By the time I was fifteen, I&#8217;d finished a novel (also terrible). By then, the idea was firmly entrenched in my head that I wanted to be published someday, but it took another decade before I actually felt comfortable submitting my work anywhere.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve just published your first novel “The Blood that Bonds” on Amazon and via Createspace. As a first timer, how would you describe this experience of uploading your book and preparing it for publication?</p>
<p>Christopher - Well, there were two separate publications &#8211; the eBook first came out in late 2009, and then I released the print edition in early 2011. Both processes were fairly complex, and I think it helped a lot that I&#8217;ve spent most of my professional life developing web-pages. The type-setting, graphic design, and scripting skills necessary to create print and eBooks are quite similar to the things I was already doing on the web.</p>
<p>Of the two, I found the print publication more difficult, just because it required exacting attention to margins and bleed areas, page size, type-formatting (I spent hours just making sure none of the fleurons in the book were left hanging at the top of a new page) and so forth. Also, the feedback process on a print book is much slower &#8211; you have to upload your stuff to Createspace, order a proof, wait a week for it to show up, and then comb it for errors. With the eBook, you upload a file and can view it instantly.</p>
<p>In both cases though, what it really comes down to is following directions. Createspace, Amazon and Smashwords all have extremely detailed information on how to format your book for publication. If you follow their guidelines, things end up working pretty well. You just have to put in the time, both reading and working on the manuscript, in order to get the best possible presentation.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your book is currently a free ebook. I notice you’ve received 152 customer reviews (quite impressive). What’s your reasoning behind releasing this as a freebie and do you intend to start charging soon?</p>
<p>Christopher - The eBook has been successful far beyond my expectations! In addition to the 152 reviews at Amazon.com, there are more than a thousand at Barnes &amp; Noble, and several hundred more at various other websites like GoodReads and LibraryThing. The total download numbers have moved past seventy thousand, which is completely ridiculous. I was thrilled when I passed the five-thousand mark!</p>
<p>I have no intention of ever charging for The Blood That Bonds in eBook format. The decision to release it for free was one I made consciously. Unlike many aspiring writers, I happen to be in the lucky position of having an alternate career that pays me pretty well. I&#8217;ve been designing and developing web pages for a living since 1997, and it&#8217;s that work that pays the bills. When I sat down and asked myself what it was I was trying to accomplish with The Blood That Bonds, I decided that it was the exposure that mattered to me more than making any money off of it, and I thought that by releasing it for free &#8211; but giving it the same love and attention that I&#8217;d have given it even if it had been picked up by a publisher &#8211; I would be able to grow an audience, and that in turn might allow me to sell future books to them. That plan seems to be working! The sequel to The Blood That Bonds, Blood Hunt, will be out this summer as an eBook. I&#8217;m pricing it at $2.99, and the most common reaction from my fans to the news that I&#8217;ll be charging for it is &#8220;that&#8217;s not enough. I&#8217;d pay more!&#8221; &#8230; which is pretty gratifying.</p>
<p>I would love to write for a living, but I&#8217;m willing to let that be a slow and steady process as my books continue, hopefully, to find new readers. With any luck, eventually they&#8217;ll be earning enough money that I won&#8217;t have to work a full-time job at the same time. We&#8217;ll see!</p>
<p>Darrell - What authors inspire you and why?</p>
<p>Christopher - Any author who&#8217;s dedicated enough to the craft to have put something out there inspires me. It&#8217;s not an easy thing! That said, I certainly have my favorites. By far the most influential author as far as my own writing goes is Stephen King. I&#8217;ve been a fan of his work since my childhood (I started reading his books in the fourth grade), and I continue to enjoy it to this day.</p>
<p>Other authors have certainly influenced and inspired me as well:</p>
<p>Christopher Moore, Anne Rice, Chuck Palahniuk, J.R.R. Tolkien, George Orwell, William Golding, J.K. Rowling, Cormac McCarthy &#8230; the list could go on for a long time. Recently I&#8217;ve been reading stuff by China Mi&#233;ville, who&#8217;s pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Darrell - What are your future writing plans?</p>
<p>Christopher -</p>
<p>Step 1. Finish vampire trilogy.</p>
<p>Step 2. ???</p>
<p>Step 3. Profit!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I don&#8217;t have a specific roadmap for the future. I&#8217;ll publish Blood Hunt this summer and am working on the final book in that series, The Children of the Sun, right now. Hopefully I&#8217;ll put that out next summer, but it might take longer. Beyond that, I have a sci-fi novel finished that&#8217;s in need of a second draft, and about a dozen ideas kicking around in my head for other books. Also I periodically write short stories, so I might write more of those too. I work pretty quickly, averaging well over 1000 words per day when I&#8217;m cranking on a specific project, and assuming Blood Hunt makes any kind of money, I should be able to afford editing, so there&#8217;s no reason I can&#8217;t continue to release books. The real question is: will people be interested in what I have to say, once I&#8217;m done telling them the story of Two and her vampire friends? Hopefully the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Darrell - If someone is trying to make it as a writer, what is the main advice you would give them?</p>
<p>Christopher - Write. Write, write, write. Write until you&#8217;re sick of writing and then make yourself write some more. And when you&#8217;re not writing, read. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you read, so much &#8211; you&#8217;re going to learn from just about anything you pick &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to mix in some more challenging work with genre fiction and graphic novels and so forth. I try to stick a classic or two into my reading list each year, and I try to read some &#8220;literary fiction&#8221; like Mark Haddon or Colm T&#243;ib&#237;n along with the sci-fi, fantasy and horror that I often prefer.</p>
<p>The other thing is to just keep trying. I&#8217;ve submitted a LOT of fiction to magazines, publishers, agents, etc &#8230; the vast majority of it hasn&#8217;t been picked up, but some has. If you spend a lot of time worrying about what&#8217;s getting accepted and what&#8217;s not, then you&#8217;re wasting time that could be spent writing. Also, stop buying books that claim to know &#8220;the secrets&#8221; to getting published. They don&#8217;t, because there aren&#8217;t any secrets &#8211; all of the information is readily available on any number of agent and publisher websites. They tell you exactly what they&#8217;re looking for. It&#8217;s up to you to write it.</p>
<p>If you must have books, buy a copy of &#8220;The Elements of Style&#8221; by Strunk &amp; White and &#8220;On Writing&#8221; by Stephen King, and you&#8217;ll get pretty much everything you&#8217;ll need to know to get published. After that, it&#8217;s just practice, dedication, and luck.</p>

<p>Gemma Halliday &#8211; Want to Be a Successful Writer? Write More Books.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune has described Gemma Halliday&#8217;s books as “A saucy combination of romance and suspense that is simply irresistible.” Obviously this is a formula that works as she has had a multitude of books in the Kindle bestseller list in recent months.</p>
<p>When I interviewed Gemma, she spoke about her method of writing and how writers can build a successful career.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Gemma - First off, thanks for having me! As for a &#8220;typical&#8221; day, I hardly ever have one of those. But here&#8217;s what I did today:</p>
<p>Hit Starbucks at about 8am, order grande latte, write for about 4 hours. Finish my latest indie mystery, HOLLYWOOD CONFESSIONS, (yay!) and send the manuscript off to my freelance editor. Grab some lunch, then head to Office Depot to buy mailing supplies, then the post office to mail off advanced reader copies of my next New York print book, a young adult mystery called DEADLY COOL, to two reviewers, one blogger, and one charity event. Then I drive home, answer some emails, check my Facebook page, and do four interviews - two for German publications, one for a Spanish magazine, and one for a Brazilian blog. Check my sales stats for the day, then I pour a glass of wine and dig into revisions for my next young adult book, SOCIAL SUICIDE. Then collapse into bed and do it all over again tomorrow!</p>
<p>Darrell - You write romantic mysteries. How does someone go about plotting a mystery book?</p>
<p>Gemma - Very carefully. ;) (I know, old joke, but I couldn&#8217;t resist.) Actually, I usually start with setting/situation then work out the victim and suspects from there. I always like to have a couple twists and turns, but those usually work themselves out very naturally for me once I know who was killed and how. The killer is that last thing I always plot out. In fact, I often change who the killer is halfway through writing the book, then I do a lot of going back and adding details and clues to make sure everything comes together in the end.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve had many successful bestselling books, including some ebooks. What do you think is the best marketing that a writer can do to promote themselves?</p>
<p>Gemma - Honestly, I think the best thing a writer can do to build a fan base is write more books. The bigger your backlist, the more of a readership you&#8217;ll gain. I think it&#8217;s important to have a website and be accessible to readers, but I&#8217;d definitely balance time spent there against making sure you have enough time to write as many books as humanly possible.</p>
<p>Darrell - How long does it normally take you to write a book, then rewrite it till it’s ready to publish?</p>
<p>Gemma - This really varies for me. The longest it&#8217;s ever taken is 9 months. The shortest is 10 days. Personally, I prefer somewhere in the middle, about 5-6 months, but deadlines and publishing schedules often dictate how much time I have to write a book, not the other way around.</p>
<p>As far as rewrites go, I don&#8217;t spend a whole lot of time rewriting my books on my own. I do a first draft that&#8217;s pretty tight, then go over probably once more to add in more details and smooth out the language. (Just finished doing this with HOLLYWOOD CONFESSIONS.) After that, I submit it either to my publisher or a freelance editor (if I&#8217;m indie pubbing it), and they come back with revisions. How many rounds of revisions we do and how extensive those are really depends on where it&#8217;s being published and what the particular editors&#8217; styles are. For my indie pubbed stuff, I usually do one round of revisions once it comes back from my freelance editor. For my upcoming hardcover release, PLAY NICE, I had one very short revision round which took me about a week. For my young adult books, that editor usually likes to do 2-3 rounds of revisions, catching the big stuff first, then whittling it down to the finer details in the last rounds. So, it all really varies depending on the project.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you think the future lies for writers now that ebooks have arrived?</p>
<p>Gemma - Wow, I wish I had my crystal ball so I could answer that one! I&#8217;m honestly not sure, but I think it&#8217;s exciting that there are many different opportunities for authors out there now. Personally, I&#8217;m publishing both traditionally and through indie ebook sources, and I love having a hand in each. I think ebooks are just going to be another great option for readers - kind of like choosing paperback or hardcover has been in the past. Depending on the situation, I could see myself picking one format over the other at different times. I will say that my own son has become a voracious reader since getting an ereader of his own, so I&#8217;m hopeful that the new instant availability of ebooks will mean that more people are reading more often.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you give to someone about to publish their first novel?</p>
<p>Gemma - Be patient. I think every author deep down has hopes that their first novel will be a runaway bestseller (I&#8217;ll admit I did!), but the truth is very few are. It takes time to build a readership and a fan base, and it often takes a backlist before you really start to see significant sales. So don&#8217;t be discouraged if sales start out slow. Every sale counts, and every bestseller has to start somewhere!</p>

<p>Marisa Mackle &#8211; How to Write a Bestseller Without Knowing How to Type</p>
<p>Marisa Mackle is an Irish writer with thirteen successful books under her belt. Traditionally a romance writer, she recently moved into children&#8217;s writing. In this interview, she spoke about her experiences as a writer and what she sees as the future for hard copy books.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Marisa - When I started writing I was an air hostess who didn’t type. I couldn’t type and I didn’t have a computer. I wrote my first novel, Mr Right for the Night, on hotel notepaper when I couldn’t sleep in hotel rooms. After a year writing and using a lot of Tipp-ex I had a book written. I took it to a typist and paid her to type it up for me. A year later it was a number one bestseller in Ireland and I still couldn’t type!</p>
<p>Darrell - Most of your books have been romances. How do you make your books stand out when there are so many romance novels in the marketplace?</p>
<p>Marisa - I write about what I know. I write about girls getting their hearts broken and being dumped and two-timed. This happens to most of us at some stage in our lives and it happened to me. But I do try and make the stories funny and I hope I can make people laugh. Romance novels have always been popular with women. We all like to think Mr Right is out there somewhere. All my books have happy endings!</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve recently released two children’s novels. What made you break into a different genre?</p>
<p>Marisa - I always wanted to write for children but I found it hard to get a publisher. The publishers all told me that there was no money in children’s books and that it was such a small market. I write for young girls so my market is even smaller. But when I became a mother, I decided that I was going to write for children and I didn’t mind if I made money or not. It was just something I really wanted to do.</p>
<p>Darrell - Illustrator Rosanna Davison was responsible for the artwork for your children’s books. How closely do you work with her to co-ordinate her artwork with your written word?</p>
<p>Marisa - Myself and my illustrator are lucky in that we are very good friends. Often authors never even meet their illustrators and the publishers work with them both separately. Rosanna reads my books and then we chat about the characters. I always see the characters very clearly in my mind and she draws them just the way I see them. It is uncanny but we do think alike anyway.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the future is for hard copy books as opposed to ebooks?</p>
<p>Marisa - I think there will always be a market for hard copy books, especially around Christmas time. They make great presents. I love the smell and feel of old books and I have books in my library that I will never throw away. I have books signed personally to me by Ethan Hawke, Naomi Wolfe, Candace Bushnell, Maeve Binchy, Marian Keyes and Cecilia Ahern and many other writers whom I have met over the years. But I do see ebooks becoming immensely popular as it is a real hassle taking five or six books in your luggage when you are travelling. Also, I think hard copy books are quite expensive and reading can be a costly habit if you read a couple of books a week like I do!</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for people wanting to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>Marisa - I meet lots of people who tell me they would like to write a book one day. I tell them not to wait for one day to come along. Write today and keep writing every single day until you get to the end of your book which should be at least seventy thousand words long. This might seem like a lot but you can easily write a book in less than three months. Writing is hard work but it’s a job that I enjoy. It is not easy and it’s not like winning the lottery. You can’t expect to become rich over night by writing a book so it’s important to do something else too. I worked as an air hostess for six years and now I have a weekly column in a newspaper. I also write articles as well as books. I don’t think anybody should be just a full-time writer because it’s unhealthy to stay in a room all day writing about people that are made-up. Life is for living so get out there and embrace it. Remember the more people you meet, the more material you will get for your books so it’s important to interact with others. I think it’s all about striking a happy balance.</p>

<p>Richard Phillips &#8211; Kindle Ebook format Leads to Bestseller Status</p>
<p>Richard Phillips was born in Roswell, New Mexico which is an interesting coincidence considering he&#8217;s a successful science fiction writer. He is the author of the bestselling Kindle series &#8211; The Rho Agenda. When I interviewed Richard, he was working on Wormhole, the third book in the series.</p>
<p>Darrell - It’s interesting that you were born in Roswell, New Mexico, home of the infamous UFO crash. Did this have any bearing on your interests in writing science fiction?</p>
<p>Richard - It certainly added an air of mystery I found fascinating.  Although the incident happened before my time, the people involved were still alive while I was growing up in the area.</p>
<p>Darrell - What writers influence you the most?</p>
<p>Richard - Dean Koontz, Michael Crichton, and Robert Ludlum.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone looking at self publishing their own ebooks?</p>
<p>Richard - Do it on the Kindle first.  Amazon’s eBook model is far superior to the other platforms when it comes to giving independent authors the opportunity to have their works discovered.  Publishing on the Kindle is easy, fast, and free.  You do have to set up an Amazon.com account and supply banking information so they can deposit your royalties. By the way, Amazon pays 70 percent royalties for books priced at least $1.99 that sell in the U.S. or Canada (35 percent otherwise). The reason Amazon is superior is simple.  They have a great system of categorization and sub-categorization.  It takes a much smaller number of sales for an author to move into a best seller list in one of the sub-categories than is required for the major categories.  For example, once you manage to make it into the top 100 bestsellers in the Sci-Fi/High Tech sub-category, people start finding you.  Then, assuming they like what they find, your sales begin rising until you move up into the next higher category of bestsellers.</p>
<p>Darrell - You have some of the most successful science fiction books on the Amazon Kindle. What do you do in the way of marketing to promote yourself?</p>
<p>Richard - Before I self-published on the Kindle, I did a variety of Pod Cast and radio interviews, as well as book signings etc.  None of that really worked.  For me, the important thing was to publish on the Kindle and to set the pricing on my first book at a price point that followed the iTunes model.  That allows people to try an unknown author without risking much money. My second novel is priced at $4.99.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your first book in the Rho Agenda series is selling for 99 cents. To what degree is pricing a factor in your publishing success?</p>
<p>Richard - I think it is an important factor for the first book. Most successful eBooks from unknown independent authors initially start at that price (you can change it at any time).  It looks to me like eBook pricing is headed toward the $2.99 price point.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you think there’s life on other planets and, if so, do you think they’ve visited Earth?</p>
<p>Richard - When I look at the number of galaxies, the number of stars in those galaxies, and the probable number of planets, I think it is extremely likely that life exists beyond earth.  Intelligent life exists on earth, so with that many throws of the cosmic dice, it probably exists elsewhere.  As to whether or not they’ve visited earth, I really can’t say.</p>

<p>Dakota Banks &#8211; First Published Book returns as a Successful Ebook</p>
<p>Growing up in a funeral home could cause issues for some people. For Dakota Banks it helped her to become a writer. She has written several novels including books under her real name of Shirley Kennett.</p>
<p>In this interview, she spoke about how she became a writer and the many interests (including Star Trek) that led to her writing success.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Dakota - I wrote my first short story when I was eight years old and had it published in the school newspaper. My parents were thrilled and I figured I just had to wait for the money to roll in. I kept writing stories but didn’t get any of them commercially published, though I accumulated some nice rejection letters. I still have them. In college I discovered a competing love (besides my husband): computers. I began a career as a programmer, then a manager, then a consultant. Several times I tried writing, but nothing came of it. Finally I decided that it was now or never, and I sat down and wrote a novel about eco-terrorism. I got an agent who loved the book, but it didn’t sell (then). I decided I’d better put some planning into my next effort, so I developed a series about a woman who was an expert in virtual reality crime scene simulations. A week after I finished it, I had a two book contract and I was on my way! Since then I’ve published eight books with a ninth coming next April.</p>
<p>One of those books was the first one I’d ever written, the one that was a flop the first time out. I looked it over with more experienced eyes, revised it, and it came out as my fifth book, BURNING ROSE, published under my real name of Shirley Kennett. Since then the rights have reverted to me, and I self-published it as an ebook. It’s available free for a limited time (<a href="http://www.shirleykennett.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.shirleykennett.com</a>). It’s been an amazing ride for that first manuscript! My initial experience with self-publishing ebooks has had a steep learning curve, because I wanted to do every step myself, including cover design. Previous ebooks I’ve had have been issued by my publisher, so I didn’t have any chance to learn. I plan to work on five more books in my backlist over the summer, so within a few months I should have six Shirley Kennett self-pubbed ebooks out there. I hope they’ll be popular, but one thing for sure: it’s been rewarding to give an older book a second life.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Dakota - I wake up around noon or 1pm and spend some time in the afternoon on the business of writing: promotion, research, the work I do for organizations I belong to, correspondence, website maintenance, and things like creating a cover and learning how to publish an ebook. I take a break for dinner and spend some time with my husband, then–I take a nap. What!! I only woke up a few hours ago. It’s my pattern of working. I sleep for a couple of hours, then get up and start my writing “day” at about 10-11 pm. I write through the night, when the house is quiet, with a single desk lamp on in my office creating a little cone of light. My two cats keep me company and think it’s wonderful that someone keeps the same hours they do. Sometime between 5-7am, I’ll fizzle out and crawl into bed. Rinse, repeat, seven days a week. I am a full-time writer, which is a good thing because I don’t know when I’d have time for another job. I don’t recommend this crazy schedule to anyone, but it works for me.</p>
<p>Also, the way I write doesn’t fit the method used by the majority of authors. Most will finish a first draft in a fairly short time, then revise the entire thing one, two, or more times. When I start a writing session, I don’t move forward into the book, I go back in the manuscript to cover the previous session’s output and edit it. When I finish editing and hit new territory for the next scene or chapter, I’m warmed up, fully into the story, and ideas are flowing. By the time I put THE END on the last page of the manuscript, it really is done (except for a check of spelling, grammar, and punctuation). All I can say about this is it suits me. As a writer, you need to find the time, setting, and method of proceeding that works best for you. Don’t be afraid to go with your instincts. There’s no wrong way to tackle writing.</p>
<p>Darrell - You grew up in a funeral home. What are your memories of that interesting environment?</p>
<p>Dakota - It was an imposing three story home built in the 1870s. In the front yard was a wall made of granite blocks, the last layer having rounded tops. When the sun was out, the blocks would heat up and become comforting to the touch. They looked like loaves of bread baking in the sun. The wall defined the edge of a driveway that went to the rear of the house, where there was a large garage. The hearse and attendant vehicles parked there. It used to be a carriage house for horse-drawn carriages. The city property wasn’t big enough for a separate stable, so the horses were kept in the carriage house, too. I could still see the place where the hay bin was, and on the wall there were hooks to hold the tack. When I lived there, the hooks were used to hold mundane things like rakes and shovels. I loved to go to the carriage house, push open the big, sliding wooden doors to let the sunshine in, and read in the hay bin. Heady stuff for a girl reading The Black Stallion series, and if I had to point to an experience that channelled me into writing, this would be it.</p>
<p>As for the rest of it, things were more sinister. You asked, though, so here it is. The house had a large front porch that had been enclosed and turned into a sunporch, an elaborate front door, and an expansive foyer with a huge mirror that was original. In my imagination, the mirror had captured and held the images of the large numbers of grieving people who had passed through that front door, along with the huge range of emotions they were feeling. Genuine loss, confusion, anger, greed, and the occasional murderous instinct. I’m sure my parents wondered why I spent time on a bench in the foyer, carefully positioned so I couldn’t see myself in the mirror. I was cooking up stories about the past.</p>
<p>Our family lived on the first floor, in an apartment carved out of the parlors where visitations for the dead were held plus the dressing room (where the deceased were dressed for their final appearance), the sales room (the basic pine box versus the fancier version with a lining), and the private room where the family could retreat if the commotion in the parlor was too much to take. My bedroom was one of the parlors, with a high ceiling, a fancy chandelier converted from gas, and a chair rail so that extra chairs could be lined up around the edges of the room if there was a crowd. The upper floors, where the funeral home’s owners and staff originally lived, had been converted into rooms for rent by the week. My parents ran a rooming house. The staircase to the upper floors was impressive. I used to imagine ghosts sweeping down the stairs, although it didn’t make sense that they’d be coming from UPstairs. It was just a perfect setting, and setting and atmosphere were important to the stories!</p>
<p>Then there was the basement.</p>
<p>The basement had been the embalming area. There were two embalming platforms (no waiting) in the centre of a large space, each having an E-Z clean porcelain top, chipped and worn from use. The reason they were not long since removed is that they were made of some kind of slick stone and anchored right into the floor. Like the pool table that gets left in the basement because it’s so much trouble to move, these remained in place over the years. There was a short flight of stairs up to a door that led to the outside, to the area in front of the carriage house. Bodies arrived that way. There were shallow trenches in the floor that ran to a drain in one corner of the room: gutters that carried away blood and contaminated water from cleaning and embalming the bodies. I was told that the drain fed the mixture out into the street, where it mixed with mud and horse droppings and apparently no one noticed. I kind of doubt this, even for the time, but I don’t know. There were bins and cubbyholes made of concrete around the edges of the space, including some that giant ancient spiders were thought to reside in. One of our cats had kittens in a supposed spider cubbyhole, and mom and little ones did fine, proving that whatever had lived there had moved on. I used to go into the basement at night with a flashlight or candle and let my imagination roam. I have a brother who is six years older than I am, and he delighted in telling gruesome stories in the basement to his spellbound little sister that almost always ended in the light going out at an intense point of the story. I knew that light was going out. I expected it. I still screamed. What fun!</p>
<p>Darrell - You’re a Star Trek fan among other things. What is there about Star Trek (and science fiction) that attracts you?</p>
<p>Dakota - I love the idea of space exploration. I think that if we can manage not to kill ourselves or our planet, that someday we’ll be travelling among the stars, meeting other intelligent life that shares our peaceful, pioneering spirit, and learning from each other. Okay, barf. I know that sounds sickeningly idealistic. If you don’t buy that one, how about this: I love action, adventure, edgy characters, exotic locations (!), geeky stuff, and gadgets. I long for a transporter. I want to be able to murmur, “Earl Gray, hot,” roll out of bed, and have my tea ready without lifting a finger other than to pick up the teacup. I want to face giant lizard things in hand-to-hand combat. I think I was born a few hundred years too soon. Or possibly 65 million years too late.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where did the idea come from for your Mortal Path books and will the next book complete the trilogy?</p>
<p>Dakota - I have a serious interest in archaeology, though not formal training. During the Iraq invasion in 2003, the Iraqi National Museum was temporarily left unguarded, and looters got in who stole and vandalized some of the world’s greatest treasures. Iraq is located on the ancient site of Sumeria, the Cradle of Civilization between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The artefacts, some as old as 7,000 years, are part of the heritage of all of us. It seemed ironic that some vase or statue could survive that long and come to an inglorious end, smashed by people behaving badly. It got me thinking about what else might have survived from that time period. I knew that Sumerian mythology was interesting, so I delved into it looking for ideas I could extrapolate. I came up with Sumerian demons left behind on Earth long after the Sumerian gods had abandoned the planet to their creations, humans. These demons, seven of them, are the cause of major troubles on Earth, such as war, diseases, and plots involving a lot of death and destruction. These negative elements have been a brake on human development and kept us from realizing our full potential. The demons are confined to the Underworld and don’t interact directly with humans. So they need servants, recruited among about-be-die or recently dead humans, to be their assassins and evil-mongers. The Mortal Path series focuses on one such recruited human, a woman named Maliha who decides after a few hundred years that she doesn’t want to be a demon’s assassin anymore. It’s not easy to undo selling your soul! The third book, Deliverance, will be out in March 2012, and is not the end of the series. The scope of the story has grown, since Maliha seeks not only personal redemption but the elimination of all the demons from the Earth, plunging humanity into … paradise? I’m aiming for a total of six books in this series. The author is supposed to know the final destination of the series, but the issues here are so large that even I don’t know how it’s going to turn out yet–or who’s going to be around to see that end.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>Dakota - The best piece of advice I have gotten is the use of the synopsis. This technique literally saved my writing life. When I wrote my first book, I started right in without planning. That book expressed my basic writing talent, but I hadn’t studied my craft enough to know how to organize a book. I thought it would all work itself out as I went along. The result was a rambling, hard to follow mish-mash (as I can see from hindsight). For my next book and every one after that, I’ve started by writing a synopsis of the story with a beginning, middle, and end, characters that both fit and create the situation, and pacing that provides the correct balance of action and breathers. All of these elements are laid bare when you boil your story down to ten pages or less. I’m not talking about a chapter outline that defines what goes in each chapter or even how many chapters there are. Just get down the high points of the story so that it makes sense and the synopsis is an exciting read in itself. This is the brainstorming portion of your writing. You still have intense creative work left to do to transform that shell of a story into an engaging novel. But–you have an overall guide to follow instead of picking your way through the jungle of the middle of the book. The synopsis is a tool, not something set in stone. If you think of a better way to handle the story, try it out in the synopsis first. It’s better to change a few pages to see if the new idea works out in short form rather than put it in your manuscript and discover that 100 pages later, you’ve put yourself in a blind corner. Writing a synopsis is a crucial skill, because you’re going to need one as a marketing device when you try to get your book published. An agent might ask for three chapters and a synopsis. Why not get double use out of that synopsis by writing it ahead of time instead of hurriedly trying to scratch one out for an agent request? And best of all, you’ll soon be getting contracts based on your synopses instead of having to write the whole books first!</p>

<p>Dolores Durando &#8211; A Bestselling novel &#8211; at age 90!</p>
<p>Some true stories are stranger than fiction. This is one of them.</p>
<p>While most people are winding down by the age of ninety (hell, a lot have wound right down), Dolores Durando has kept herself busy by writing and publishing her first novel.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Dolores Durando just had her first novel published &#8211; and she&#8217;s ninety years old. Even more incredible is the fact her book, Beyond the Bougainvillea, spent quite some time as a freebie on Amazon&#8217;s top 100 Free downloads. (These days we all have to pay for it &#8211; damn!)</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve written and published your first book at age ninety. What have you been doing all these years?</p>
<p>Dolores - I was one of the women considered to be &#8220;Rosie the Riveters&#8221; who worked at Douglas Aircraft, Santa Monica, CA during the &#8220;war to end all wars.&#8221; I raised four children; three who joined me to established and maintained five homes for mentally ill adults.  I worked part to fulltime in State Hospitals for 35 years prior to retiring to Oregon at 70 years old.  I have served on Mental Health and Addiction Advisory Boards both in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>After moving to Oregon I began to raise Mediterranean Miniature Donkeys.  Since I was a North Dakota farm girl this came naturally.  I was involved in breeding, training and showing donkeys until 2009.  I have served on the National Miniature Donkey Association Board of Directors for the past 14 years.</p>
<p>I also enjoy sculpting in alabaster, painting with watercolors and now, my new challenge, novels.  I have always enjoyed writing short stories, some of which have been published in National publications.</p>
<p>Darrell - What are the similarities and the differences between your own life and Beyond The Bougainvillea?</p>
<p>Dolores - I learned to survive as Marge did and we share the same values. My children were the driving force behind my ambition to provide a better life.  I never thought myself beautiful as Marge was, I never owned a &#8220;Marge&#8217;s Place&#8221; I only worked in one and there was never a &#8220;Cotton&#8221; for me.</p>
<p>Darrell - Most people are well and truly winding down at age ninety. What is your secret to longevity?</p>
<p>Dolores - I never learned to smoke and after two hangovers, alcohol was never a temptation!  Good genes, inherited from my Norwegian father and Pennsylvania Dutch mother.  Staying active and interested in life, to sum it all up I&#8217;ve lived a full life and am ready to go, but please God! not before I finish my next book.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your book has been one of the top 100 downloaded free books on the Amazon Kindle. How did it become so successful?</p>
<p>Dolores - Beginner&#8217;s luck. Perhaps because the characters and most situations were based on reality or very nearly so.  I surely took liberties with both.</p>
<p>It is my hope that women throughout the world are able to identify with Marge&#8217;s struggle to survive. When I think of Marge I think of Maya Angelou when she wrote “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.”</p>
<p>Darrell - What authors have most inspired you in your writing?</p>
<p>Dolores - I have read voraciously since I was a small child.  I devoured Zane Grey, while sitting on a horse, herding cattle on a North Dakota prairie.</p>
<p>Books that have influenced my life; everything by Maya Angelou, Pat Conroy&#8217;s Prince of Tides, Anne Siddon&#8217;s Peach Tree Street and their heartbreakingly beautiful descriptions of the marshlands. Ivan Doig&#8217;s beautiful book Dancing at the Rascal Fair, Larry McMurtry&#8217;s Lonesome Dove-there are so many wonderful writers how could I choose?</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for anyone trying to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>Dolores - Write about what you know.</p>
<p>Writing, I love.  It isn&#8217;t work, it isn&#8217;t a duty.  It is essential to make me feel complete, fulfilled.  It is an all-consuming passion.</p>
<p>My advice: don&#8217;t settle for anything less.</p>

<p>Andy Briggs &#8211; Write More Books to Become a Successful Author</p>
<p>Andy Briggs has had a varied and successful career. As well as writing films with his brother, he has written an eight book series (hero.com and villain.net) and comics for Markosia Comics. When this interview was conducted, he had just recently released a brand new Tarzan novel - Tarzan: The Greystoke Legacy.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Andy - I was lucky enough to break into films first. I wrote a lot with my brother, Peter Briggs, on movies and TV shows such as the Highlander TV Show, Judge Dredd and Freddy vs Jason.  I used the opportunity to spread out, writing graphic novels and books too.  It keeps me busy</p>
<p>Darrell - You seem to be a writing machine judging by your output. How long does it take to write a book and get it ready for publication?</p>
<p>Andy - Publishers love long lead times of at least a year. Tarzan was a project I have been developing for 2 years, but the first year was working with the Edgar Rice Burroughs Estate, then the second year with Faber who are publishing it. With the second Tarzan book, TARZAN: JUNGLE WARRIOR, I only have about 7 months from finishing to publication!</p>
<p>Darrell - What writers inspire you?</p>
<p>Andy - Douglas Adams, Michael Crichton, Clive Cussler and many more…</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way for a writer to market themselves?</p>
<p>Andy - That’s a very interesting question!  When most writers I speak to talk about “marketing” they think of Facebook and other Social Networks.  I think a writer should market themselves by thinking about the career they want. I enjoy telling a variety of stories across many formats - so I would hate to market myself has the “horror screenwriter” or even the “children’s author”.  I think writers should market themselves to publishers and agents by writing a variety of different genres and in different media.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the fate for hard copy books now that ebooks are on the scene?</p>
<p>Andy - When TV came along everybody said it was the death of the cinema.  I believe hard copy books will always be around. When I was last on vacation I saw NO ipads or Kindles left on sun beds, but plenty of paperbacks.  If anything I believe it will encourage more people to read - after all, who cares how they read, as long as they do?</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to break into the business of writing?</p>
<p>Andy - Write as many different stories as you can.  If you write one book then your chances of getting it published at slim.  Write ten books and you have just increased your odds. Never give up, but be realistic - writing a teenage vampire love story right now will probably be a waste of time as that market is swamped.  But in X amount of years people’s appetites will wonder in that direction again.</p>

<p>Tessa Gratton &#8211; Writers Need Adventure As Fuel</p>
<p>Tessa Gratton has this to say about herself:</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be a wizard. Or a palaeontologist. Maybe both.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m neither now, but magic and monsters are still my favourite things.</p>
<p>The daughter of a navy father, Tessa moved around during her childhood and grew up developing a love of writing and theatre. The author of &#8220;Blood Magic&#8221;, she now lives in Kansas with her partner, two cats, and a mutant mutt named Grendel.</p>
<p>Darrell - What’s a typical day of writing like for you?</p>
<p>Tessa - I wake up around 6am, brew coffee, and while I drink it I read emails and blogs, check twitter. When I settle down to write, it can last anywhere from an hour to 8 hours. Sometimes I break to exercise, and there are always little moments for tweeting or more emails, like between scenes or when I&#8217;m thinking about the next line of a conversation. I chat with my critique partner, too. And eat a lot of cold cereal.</p>
<p>Darrell - Paranormal and mystery books seem to be an enormous hit right now. Why do you think this is?</p>
<p>Tessa - I don&#8217;t know about mystery novels &#8211; and my understanding of paranormal trends only extends through the young adult genre. I think there&#8217;s a lot of room to play in paranormal stories &#8211; they mostly take place in the real world, but work in an element or two of magic. It&#8217;s fun to imagine what it would be like to run into goblins in an alley of your town, or a vampire at the grocery store &#8211; that&#8217;s what paranormal taps into for me at least. The connections between the magical and the mundane.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you find a publisher?</p>
<p>Tessa - I got an agent, and she put together a list of editors at publishing houses she thought it might appeal to, then pitched the book to them. She&#8217;s worth her weight in gold!</p>
<p>Darrell - What marketing tools do you use to promote yourself e.g. magazine advertising, Facebook, direct email?</p>
<p>Tessa - I only use social networking such as my blog, Twitter, and Facebook. I don&#8217;t do direct marketing, but instead just try to entertain people. I hope that makes them seek out my books &#8211; but if not, I&#8217;m still having a good time!</p>
<p>Darrell - I notice you have a number of publishers and countries listed on your website for Foreign language rights. How does all that work?</p>
<p>Tessa - We sold Random House Children&#8217;s Books the world rights to BLOOD MAGIC, which means that their subrights team sells translation rights to publishers around the world. I have nothing to do with it, other than cheering them along! And they have been fabulous for me! The book was taken out early, to last year&#8217;s Bologna Children&#8217;s Book Fair, and several of the sales have come out of that.</p>
<p>Darrell - What would be the main advice you would give to new writers?</p>
<p>Tessa - Go out and have adventures! You need to live life to be able to write about it!</p>

<p>Gordon Ferris &#8211; Over 250,000 Kindle Ebooks Sold</p>
<p>Gordon Ferris grew up in the west of Scotland, enjoying both rugby and writing from an early age. He eventually worked as a programmer for the RAF before becoming an integral part of the Price Waterhouse company.</p>
<p>Long haul flights and a laptop led him to returning to his first love &#8211; writing &#8211; and the results of this were clearly evident in his success with his book, The Hanging Shed. Since this interview was conducted, he has sold over 250,000 ebooks.</p>
<p>Both The Hanging Shed and Truth Dare Kill reached number one in the Amazon Kindle list for several weeks. Bitter Water - the sequel to The Hanging Shed &#8211; will be released shortly.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you decide to become a writer after working in many other various jobs over the years?</p>
<p>Gordon - It’s a bit pompous to say that it was in the blood, but playing with words was the only ‘work’ that ever excited me. None of the corporate stuff satisfied my creative urge. Twelve years ago, I decided life was too short and I couldn’t / shouldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Gordon - There’s nothing typical. It depends where I am in the writing cycle. Some days are more filled with research than others. But I do try to get in front of my screen first thing in the morning and just write. I’m learning to trust myself; creating characters and letting them loose on the ‘page’. My job is to describe the scene and the dialogue that ensues. Like watching a video in my head.</p>
<p>Darrell - What sort of marketing do you think works for a writer?</p>
<p>Gordon - I wish I knew! But on the basis of the last three months in which three of my books are sitting in the top 20 Amazon UK Kindle list, the best publicity is 5 star reviews from readers!  The emergence of the ‘social network’ has transformed publishing and no-one has really worked out the best way of ‘going viral’, the internet version of ‘word of mouth’. Ebooks and readers’ forums are a start.</p>
<p>Darrell - On your website you mention your book “The Hanging Shed” has notched up some 50,000 sales, at &#163;1 a time, in the Kindle eBooks charts, where it has consistently been in the top five.” This is a fantastic achievement. How did you do it?</p>
<p>Gordon - It’s now well over 100,000. My clever publisher [Nic Cheetham at Corvus] came up with the brainwave of pitching ‘12 days at Christmas’ to Amazon. He offered 12 new titles from 25 December for 12 days at &#163;1 a pop. Other publishers piled in. As readers bought books and reviews came through, the people’s choice propelled their favourites to the top. I’ve been in the top 5 for three months now, including several weeks at No 1. It seems to be almost self-perpetuating: just being visible in the charts leads readers to buy it, they submit glowing reviews, and the cycle continues. Indeed, the success of The Hanging Shed has given a new lease of publishing life to my earlier two books. Truth Dare Kill is now at No 2 on kindle, two above The Hanging Shed!</p>
<p>Darrell - The Hanging Shed’s protagonist is Douglas Brodie. Have you begun working on a sequel?</p>
<p>Gordon - I’m well advanced on Brodie 2. Working title is BITTER WATER. It’s again set in Glasgow and stars Brodie. It’s summer and as the city sizzles [it does get hot sometimes in Scotland] a gang of vigilantes starts taking the law into their own hands. Brodie is invited to join them . . .</p>
<p>Darrell - What single piece of advice would you give to someone trying to make it as a successful author?</p>
<p>Gordon - Don’t even start. Not unless you’re utterly determined to write, year in year out, walls papered with rejection slips, without being published. Writing is a craft, not for dilettantes. It can only come by unwavering self-belief and hard graft.</p>

<p>Richard Harland &#8211; Liberating the Writer Within</p>
<p>Richard is the author of over fifteen novels and is an example of one of those writers who has plugged away for years and is now reaping the rewards. When I interviewed Richard, his steampunk book, Worldshaker, had just been published in Australia, the US, UK, France, Germany and Brazil. The sequel &#8211; Liberator &#8211; has now also been released.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you get your ideas and inspiration?</p>
<p>Richard - Out of thin air. Seriously. I make stuff up all the time. I have no idea where any of it comes from. (Not from a Pit of Lurking Deep Ideas, as per the cartoon image in my guide to writing fantasy and SF at <a href="http://www.writingtips.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.writingtips.com.au</a>!)</p>
<p>Darrell - When you&#8217;re writing a novel, do you plot the entire book in advance or work it out as you go?</p>
<p>Richard - I’m a plotter! Except that that makes it sound as though I do diagrams and chapter outlines and such … Which sometimes I do, but only incidentally to the real work of imagination going on. I guess I have an unusual kind of visual imagination that lets me hold a story in my head like a movie long before I need to set it down in words.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve even discovered a talent for writing synopses&#8212;which all writers dread and curse. Unavoidable when you’re a professional writer aiming for a contract before you set fingers to keyboard! I still curse, but I don’t dread, because I’ve realized how much easier it is for me than most people. I enjoy thinking up and filling out a story, then letting it play in my head like a movie&#8212;so, turning it into a few compressed pages is a bit like describing a movie to a friend.</p>
<p>I’ve learned not to overplan, though. Nowadays, I can sense when I’ve got enough material for a good, big climax (and anyone who’s read my books know how much I love good, big climaxes&#8212;with Liberator, the climax literally starts before half way through and doesn’t stop rolling for another 250 pages. The habit is growing on me!) However, I’m happy to leave the climax in a nebulous state&#8212;I can tell when it&#8217;s going to work out right long before I get there. And if the story as I write it diverges from my movie, well, that’s fine too. I never argue with the story.</p>
<p>Darrell - You very famously had a bad case of writer&#8217;s block that lasted 25 years and you have some thirty unfinished manuscripts lying about in the bottom of a cupboard. How do you get past writer&#8217;s block?</p>
<p>Richard - This will sound like a page from Auntie Mame’s Golden Book of Advice for Boys and Girls &#8230; Good, regular writing habits! Self-discipline! A set time to start and finish writing every day!</p>
<p>Well, I should know. I used to think like a poet, waiting for inspiration, having my best ideas late at night, very bohemian. I always had pen and paper beside my bed, and often kept myself up all night with the ideas I was having. Great&#8212;except I never actually got to write them out. Fever-hot creativity, but no goddamn motivation!</p>
<p>Now I start work straight after breakfast every day. I know I’m going to write, and I do write.  If I get bogged, I don’t panic, I just back off and spread out over the episodes to come, watching my movie until I’m enjoying the story again. Maybe it takes a day or two or three, but eventually I’ll always see my way over the hump, often with a slight change of direction.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the secret to writing success?</p>
<p>Richard - I could tell you, but then I’d have to kill you… I don’t think there is a secret, except, in the first place, be very persistent, and in the second place, be very lucky. I believe you should always write the best story that’s in you to write, because chasing success is a loser’s game. But when you’re sure about the best story that’s in you to write, think of the reader too. I mean, a novel is created in conjunction with your readers, and you need to live the reader’s experience as you write.</p>
<p>Darrell - When you say &#8216;the best story that&#8217;s in you to write&#8217;, writers usually have to write more than one book to be a success.</p>
<p>Richard - When I say, ‘the best story that’s in you to write’, hopefully there’s more than just one. Writing careers are built on a whole succession of books. You have to believe the one you’re writing is the very best you have in you … And then later discover another one hiding inside that’s even better than your best!</p>
<p>Darrell - What would be the main advice you would give to new writers?</p>
<p>Listen to what other people say about your writing, and believe some but not all of it.</p>

<p>Linda Wisdom &#8211; Sixty Published Novels and Counting</p>
<p>Linda Wisdom has been writing romance novels for over thirty years and in that time she has published more than sixty books. She has twice been nominated for a Romantic Times Reviewer’s Choice Award and been a winner of the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award. When I interviewed her, she had just released another book - Demons Are a Girl’s Best Friend.</p>
<p>Darrell - I know you began writing for Silhouette Books then moved on to Dell and Harlequin, but how did you become a writer in the first place?</p>
<p>Linda - I always wanted to write. I wrote short stories as a kid and novella length through high school. I was lucky enough to have a journalism instructor in high school who critiqued and encouraged my work. Ironically, my journalism advisor in college told me I didn’t have a future in fiction writing. I guess I showed her!</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing for you?</p>
<p>Linda - I’m not sure it’s typical. I usually check my email first and if I’m on a blog tour, I check in there. Otherwise, I get to work. I tend to backtrack about five or ten pages to help myself up to speed. I work three hours in the morning, break for lunch and playtime with the dog, then I check blogs and email and back to work for several hours. The perils of too many years at the computer means back problems, so I advise everyone to take frequent breaks. I don’t think of writing a certain number of words or pages each day. It’s whatever I’m comfortable with. Some days I’m cooking. Other days I could be struggling to the point that housework looks more appealing!</p>
<p>Darrell - You have a number of books available on Kindle. Where do you think the future market lies in relation to paperback and ebooks?</p>
<p>Linda - I’ve seen ebooks grow in quality and number over the years. There’s always going to be readers who prefer paperbacks, but as one who acquired a Nook last year and am now totally hooked, I think more will go that route. Especially when they realize how many books they can carry around in an ereader. I also have to say I’ve discovered a lot of new authors to me. Either because one of their books was offered as a free book or I find it on a blog catering to ereaders.</p>
<p>Darrell - There seems to be a line drawn in the sand between ‘literary’ books and popular novels. Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Linda - There’s always going to be a dividing line in any type of fiction. When I was first published in category romantic fiction I was always asked when I’d write a ‘real’ book. Or one genre looks down on another. We’re all writers, creating what we love. You’d think that would count, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>Darrell - You’re an author who does book signings. What do you see as being the benefits of this?</p>
<p>Linda - I think it’s the chance for an author to meet the readers. You may not sell a lot of books, but it’s a great way to also meet the booksellers, and sometimes sit around and chat.</p>
<p>Darrell - How would you suggest someone market themselves if they are just starting out with their first published book?</p>
<p>Linda - They need to see what niche they fit in. Use all the social networks to talk about their book, hope for reviews and tagging the books. Even checking out blogs that cater to ebooks and see if they can guest blog there. People can’t buy a book if they don’t know about it.</p>

<p>B.V. Larson &#8211; Ebook Publishing Giant</p>
<p>B. V. Larson is a science fiction and fantasy author and one of the few writers to have sold over 100,000 eBooks. That&#8217;s quite an achievement and one many writers would envy.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the secret of his success? In this interview he shared his thoughts on writing and offers advice on how to break into the ebook market.</p>
<p>Darrell - What’s a typical day of writing like for you?</p>
<p>BV - I write 7 days a week for about 2 to 3 hours a day when I&#8217;m writing&#8230; which is almost always these days. I usually work in the afternoons after morning classes and before night classes (I teach college as well as write).</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you want to become a writer and how did it happen?</p>
<p>BV - I started out writing when I was a teenager, simply because I was in love with books and wanted to create my own. Success took a long time, but it happened the only way I think it can happen: I wrote a lot of books. After long years spent learning my trade, people have come to like what I write, and I now sell more than a thousand books a day.</p>
<p>Darrell - How long does it normally take you to write a book and do you go through many rewrites?</p>
<p>BV - Books take me 2 months to a year to write, usually. I rewrite each day I sit down to write, starting by going over the last chapter or so and reworking it. That gets me thru the first draft. I do about four drafts before I release a book. The first and second drafts I do myself, the third and fourth draft are reworks after an editor has gone over the manuscript and given me fixes and comments, etc.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your books are for sale for only $2.99. How big an issue is pricing in relation to sales?</p>
<p>BV - Pricing is key for any new Indie author. I&#8217;ve seen people succeed with much higher or lower prices than I have. You can and should experiment. Sometimes a book will sell more at a higher price, sometimes much less.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you have any advice about marketing and how you get yourself known out there?</p>
<p>BV - Frankly, I would suggest writing good books with good titles-covers-prices-descriptions. That&#8217;s the magic. I have no platform. My college students don&#8217;t even know I write fiction. (Hence, the penname). Put up good books that people want to read and you will succeed.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for writers who are trying to get their first ebook published?</p>
<p>BV - To me, this question makes no sense. Anyone can publish an ebook. Getting people to read it is the hard part. I would say the best piece of advice would be to look at your category and study every book on the top 20 bestselling ebooks. Download and read every sample, if not the whole book. Do what they do. I don&#8217;t mean copy their book, I mean in terms of how they wrote the description, the way the cover looks, etc. Make sure your book resembles the winning titles in the top twenty in some way.</p>
<p>Darrell - And finally, what does B.V. stand for or is it a secret and those who find out the answer mysteriously disappear?</p>
<p>BV - B. V. Larson was originally a penname suggested by Wayne Wightman, an excellent author and writing teacher who helped me get started with writing (you can look him up on Amazon, too). I&#8217;ve written under that name for years. I stick to the name because I&#8217;m also a college professor, and I didn&#8217;t want to be seen as pressuring my students to buy my books. The penname helps me keep my two careers separate.</p>

<p>Stephen Leather &#8211; Ninety-nine Cent Price No Barrier To Ebook Success</p>
<p>An internationally successful thriller writer, Stephen Leather has published more than twenty thrillers. He has also had a variety of jobs. He has worked as a journalist, a baker, a barman and a biochemist. He has also worked in television.</p>
<p>Darrell - What’s a typical day of writing like for you?</p>
<p>Stephen - Depends on what stage I am with the book. At the moment I’m trying to finish my new Jack Nightingale supernatural thriller Nightmare so I’m writing 18 hours a day!  I haven’t shaved or showered for three days so it’s pretty unpleasant!</p>
<p>Darrell - As a thriller writer, how do you build up tension and suspense in your books?</p>
<p>Stephen - Ha ha. It takes years of practice!  I try to end a scene with something happening, and to join a scene where something is already happening. Very short scenes help.  But there’s no magic formula, no secret recipe!</p>
<p>Darrell - I understand you’re currently selling around 2,000 ebooks a day. What strategy would you suggest writers employ to achieve the same results?</p>
<p>Stephen - You have to write books that people enjoy reading. It’s as easy and as hard as that.  But a key factor with eBooks is price. A new writer who wants to be discovered really has no choice other than to sell them as cheaply as possible. On the Kindle that means 99 cents, equivalent to 71p. Then when you have put your eBook on sale you have to spend a lot of time promoting it. Promoting and marketing are as hard as writing the book in the first place.</p>
<p>Darrell - Marketing is important to any writer, but is it especially important when you become your own (ebook) publisher. What are the main marketing tools you employ to communicate with your readers?</p>
<p>Stephen - Facebook, blogs, internet forums.  Plus you need a good website.</p>
<p>If you can get the regular media enthusiastic, that’s great. But it’s hard!</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the future holds for paperbacks and hard cover novels?</p>
<p>Stephen - Sales of regular books will fall and sales of eBooks will keep rising, but there will always be a market for ‘real’ books. I wouldn’t want to take a Kindle on the beach and the light has to be just right to read them indoors. And if you drop a Kindle into the bath it’s finished! Also most people still like to have a shelf of books - I certainly do.</p>
<p>Darrell - What would be the main advice you would give to new writers?</p>
<p>Stephen - Keep writing. And read a lot. And don’t give up. Nothing that’s worth having comes easily. Except the lottery, of course….</p>

<p>Anna Campbell &#8211; Want to be a Successful Author? Here&#8217;s how&#8230;</p>
<p>Anna Campbell is a wonderful example of someone who wanted to make it as a writer and put in the hard yards to achieve their goal. After writing her first novel, it took her twenty-seven years to achieve publishing success with her book Claiming the Courtesan. She attributes much of her success to being a member of the Romance Writers of Australia.</p>
<p>In this interview she spoke about the importance of belonging to a supportive writing organisation that helps you achieve your writing goals.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Anna - Hi Darrell! Thanks for talking to me today. One of the things I like about writing is that there really isn&#8217;t a typical day. I generally divide my day between promotion and writing with writing taking a larger and larger slice closer to deadline.</p>
<p>Darrell - You had several years of writing before finally breaking into the big time with Claiming the Courtesan. Did you feel your standard of writing move from amateur to professional when you wrote this book or was it simply a long, slow process of improvement in the previous years?</p>
<p>Anna - I actually finished my first historical romance after high school and it was twenty-seven years after that that I sold Claiming the Courtesan to Avon in New York. I think I always had a pretty good grip on the mechanics of writing although all those years in the unpublished wilderness meant I had a wonderful opportunity to develop my voice. The thing that made a difference between Claiming the Courtesan and my previous manuscripts is that I&#8217;d finally learned to write emotion.</p>
<p>Darrell - What research do you do to write historical romance novels?</p>
<p>Anna - After writing six Regency-set romances (and an unpublished manuscript under the bed), I&#8217;ve got a fairly good general knowledge of the Regency now. But there&#8217;s usually something specific I have to research in depth for each story. For Untouched, it was the treatment of mental illness in the early 19th century and for Captive of Sin, it was the East India Company. I&#8217;ve also been lucky enough to visit the UK, where the books are set, on a regular basis &#8211; wandering around stately homes or green countryside definitely counts as research!</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve spoken before about the importance of being a member of Romance Writers of Australia. In what way has this helped you as a writer?</p>
<p>Anna - In so many ways! If you&#8217;re interested in writing romance, I&#8217;d definitely recommend joining RWAustralia (&lt;<a href="http://www.romanceaustralia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.romanceaustralia.com/</a>&gt;). They run contests, crit groups, several email loops and a monthly newsletter. Each year, they also have a wonderful conference where you can meet romance writers from all over the world. I&#8217;ve also made some wonderful friends through RWA &#8211; nobody understands the ups and downs of a writer&#8217;s life like another writer.</p>
<p>Darrell - What methods of marketing have worked the most for you in promoting your books?</p>
<p>Anna - I think the best advertising for your books is to write another good book.</p>
<p>I enjoy the social media sites, especially Facebook (my fan page is &lt;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/AnnaCampbellFans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.facebook.com/AnnaCampbellFans</a>&gt; and I&#8217;d love to see you there). I have a pretty comprehensive website (<a href="http://www.annacampbell.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.annacampbell.info</a>) that I update monthly &#8211; a good website is the absolute minimum promotional requirement from an author these days. I do talks and workshops and I give away a lot of books. I think you develop a fan base reader by reader.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you think writing will change now that ebooks are on the market?</p>
<p>Anna - That&#8217;s the million dollar question, isn&#8217;t it? I think it&#8217;s too early to say exactly what effect digital books will have on the market as a whole. A good story will still be a good story but I think one benefit of the e-book explosion will be that there will be a greater variety of stories for readers to enjoy.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>Anna - Write, write and write some more. There&#8217;s a lot of noise out there at the moment and it&#8217;s easy to get distracted, but if you want to succeed as a writer, you need to do the hard work of getting the words on the page.</p>

<p>Blake Crouch &#8211; Good Writing Pushes Ebook Sales</p>
<p>Blake Crouch is a Colorado writer and has published in both the print and ebook fields. As well as appearing in several short story anthologies, he co-wrote &#8220;Serial&#8221; with J.A. Konrath which was downloaded over 350,000 times and topped the Kindle bestseller list for 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Darrell - Paranormal and mystery books seem to head the list of ebook sellers. Do you think certain genres have an advantage in relation to ebook sales?</p>
<p>Blake - Well, I think there&#8217;s a lot of good mystery and thriller fiction being written right now. It&#8217;s what I love to read most, and I&#8217;m just glad there are a lot of other people who feel the same way.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a normal day of writing to me?</p>
<p>Blake - It&#8217;s different every day&#8230;sometimes I&#8217;m busy uploading work to a new platform&#8230;there often long stretches of working on a novella or novel on my own in isolation (this is my favourite thing to do), and other times, I&#8217;m working on a collaboration, in which case, there could be ten and twelve hour writing days. When it’s new release time, I’m usually emailing a ton and busy doing interviews.</p>
<p>Darrell - Most of your ebooks have a price tag of $2.99. How important is price in relation to sales?</p>
<p>Blake - That&#8217;s a tough question. I&#8217;m still experimenting with pricing, but I think it&#8217;s important to set your books at a price that customers respond to. I have my short fiction available individually for $.99, my novellas and novels for $2.99, my short fiction collections for $3.99, and my complete short fiction collection for $4.99. It seems to be working now, so I&#8217;m hesitant to mess with it. I would like to experiment down the road with $.99 and $4.99 novels.</p>
<p>Darrell - Ebook websites provide short samples of the novel - often the first chapter - what is the benefit of this for writers?</p>
<p>Blake - The ability to read a sample before making a purchase is crucial. It&#8217;s just like walking through a bookstore and reading the first couple pages of a book you&#8217;re considering buying.</p>
<p>Darrell - What marketing tools do you use to promote yourself e.g. magazine advertising, Facebook, direct email?</p>
<p>Blake - Facebook, website, newsletter, guest blogging, posting to certain forums, but mainly continuing to write and release new books.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the future holds for the hard copy printed page?</p>
<p>Blake - I think people will always want to read printed books. I’m one of them, even though I love my Kindle. This is why I’m making all of my work available on a POD basis for hardcore, dead-tree book lovers.</p>

<p>David Lender &#8211; A Financial Thriller</p>
<p>David Lender is a name we&#8217;ll probably be hearing quite a bit of. He has been compared to David Baldacci, he writes thrillers set within the financial sector and he has had books on the Kindle Bestseller list. This is quite impressive for someone who once had a literary agent tell him his writing was &#8216;not bad&#8217;.</p>
<p>When I interviewed David, he had just published two books with a third on the way. He has since released a fourth novel.</p>
<p>Darrell - You have twenty-five years of experience in the financial sector. When did you decide you wanted to become a writer and how did it happen?</p>
<p>David - I always wanted to write&#8212;in college I was an English major and saw my future profession as &#8220;Novelist&#8221;.  But I didn&#8217;t make it happen until later in my life.  I worked on Wall Street for over 25 years in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions business, for mainstream firms such as Merrill Lynch, the Rothschilds and BofA; that profession doesn&#8217;t allow for much time to do anything else.  But I started writing about 15 years ago.  I got up at 5:00 a.m., doing my bike workout and then writing for about an hour before heading to the office.  On my commute home I&#8217;d outline scenes I&#8217;d then write the next morning.  It took me about a year to finish my first novel, a thriller. I wrote the second novel the same way as the first&#8212;up at 5 a.m., outlining on the bus or train, in the car service, on airplanes, anyplace.  Rewriting and editing drafts wherever and whenever I could.  It took about another year.  I don&#8217;t think my process was much different than anyone else&#8217;s.  I think writers just have an urge, or compulsion to tell their stories.  They eventually get around to it, shoehorning in the time whatever way they can around their day jobs.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your book “Trojan Horse” is currently sitting at number twenty on the Kindle Bestseller list at ninety-nine cents. Has this price point mostly had a positive impact on your sales?</p>
<p>David - I am certain the price point had a lot to do with Trojan Horse&#8217;s success to date.  I launched it at $9.99, cut it to $6.99 after a few weeks, then $2.99 for a month or so.  When I went to $0.99 it took off.   During that time period I was educating myself on epublishing.  I read blogs by Joe Konrath, Stephen Leather and Amanda Hocking.  Also Kindle Review, Kindle Nation Daily, eReader News Today and The Frugal eReader.  I joined a Kindle writing group online.  I read Steve Windwalker&#8217;s excellent How to Price eBooks for the Kindle.  I started thinking about the notion that at $0.99 I could capture the largest number of potential readers as an unknown.  And that even if the increased volume of sales at that price point didn&#8217;t make up for difference in royalties, my primary goal at this stage should be to expose the maximum possible number of readers to my writing.  I don&#8217;t see how Trojan Horse could have hit</p>
<h1 id="20-on-the-Kindle-Bestseller-list-at-a-higher-price-right-now-I-launched-my-second-book-The-Gravy-Train-at-0-99-on-Kindle-about-two-weeks-ago-and-will-be-releasing-my-next-Bull-Street-at-0-99-on-Kindle-unless-the-world-somehow-changes-in-the-coming-months"><a href="#20-on-the-Kindle-Bestseller-list-at-a-higher-price-right-now-I-launched-my-second-book-The-Gravy-Train-at-0-99-on-Kindle-about-two-weeks-ago-and-will-be-releasing-my-next-Bull-Street-at-0-99-on-Kindle-unless-the-world-somehow-changes-in-the-coming-months" class="headerlink" title="20 on the Kindle Bestseller list at a higher price right now.

I launched my second book, The Gravy Train, at $0.99 on Kindle about two weeks ago, and will be releasing my next, Bull Street, at $0.99 on Kindle unless the world somehow changes in the coming months.</h1><p>Darrell - On your website you relate the story of a literary agent who looked at your first book and said, “Not bad for somebody who doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing yet.&#8221;You were then hooked up with an editor who helped mentor you. How important is having a mentor and how did your mentor help you become a successful author?</p>
<p>David - My mentor taught me how to write a commercially viable thriller.  An aspiring writer can read all the books on writing he wants, and write until his fingers bleed, but without being run through the meatgrinder by a serious editor I don&#8217;t see how he can learn to write successfully.  It takes an understanding of structure, conflict, point of view, character, premise and what a scene is or isn&#8217;t, for starters.  Those things don&#8217;t just bubble up out of your subconscious on their own.  Somebody&#8217;s got to slam you over the head with them.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your novels have a similar theme on the cover - Wall Street - with a similar font for the titles. Do you have much to do with the branding of your books and is there anything else you do in the way of marketing?</p>
<p>David - My father took the photos I&#8217;m using on the covers.  Trojan Horse is &#8220;The Man in White&#8221; (look inside the &#8220;d&#8221; in &#8220;Lender&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see him jaywalking across traffic).  My father was a talented amateur photographer all his life.  I intend to use his photos as long as I can find shots in his considerable library that match the mood and subject of my books, and that allow for some recognizability of my covers.  I also chose the font intentionally as a branding item.  That could change in time, but for now I think it helps develop some consistency for my titles.  On marketing, I&#8217;ve done some guest blogs, interviews and sponsored some Books of the Day on Kindle Nation Daily, BookLending.com, eReader News Today and The Frugal eReader.  It&#8217;s about trying to connect with potential readers where they look for what to read next, an inexact science.</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you think there’s a future for paperback novels or do you think they will all go the way of the dinosaur and ebooks will reign supreme?</p>
<p>David - I think print books, both hardcover and paperback, will always exist.  Some people just want the feel of a book in their hands, or aren&#8217;t comfortable with the ereader, and some just want the mystique of ownership with books on their shelves.  Trojan Horse is available in paperback and The Gravy Train will be out in paperback shortly.  Bull Street will be released on Kindle and in paperback.  I do believe that ebooks will become at least as big a factor as physical books.</p>
<p>Darrell - If someone is trying to make it as a writer, what is the main advice you would give them?</p>
<p>David - If you have the urge and you haven&#8217;t started writing yet, start.  If you have started, keep writing.  And, to borrow from Winston Churchill, never, never, never give up.  But learn about craft and structure.  Study your favorite authors, learn how they do things like set up scenes, craft dialog, slide in back story on characters, build drama and tension.  And if you can, find a good mentor or editor.</p>

<p>Ricki Thomas &#8211; ‘Gentle’ Author is Knocking ‘em Dead</p>
<p>One of the books to reach the top of the Amazon UK list was Ricki Thomas&#8217;s &#8220;Unlikely Killer&#8221;. One reviewer said that Ricki will &#8220;take you on a journey into the darkest recesses of the human mind&#8221;. Another reviewer simply said, &#8220;brilliant. fast paced. a book that gets you hooked from the first page&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since this interview, she has also released another book, &#8220;Hope&#8217;s Vengeance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Ricki - I was running a successful business as an accountant, but when I turned that dreaded ‘30’ I knew I wasn’t happy with the tedium and office politics, so I closed the business and became a pauper, writing my socks off with a view to achieving either with a novel or script. So, nine penniless years later, my first book, Hopes Vengeance, was published, followed shortly after by Unlikely Killer, which is happily becoming pretty successful.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Ricki - I’m not quite sure there is a typical day. If I’m ‘locked into’ a book, I’ll do nothing but write, day in, night out. But if anything at all isn’t right, perhaps I feel the book may have flaws, or, and this is being totally honest, the dishes aren’t done, it can put me on a ‘block’ for weeks, sad but true! I’ve learned to not stress over the blocks, because they always resolve in my head at some stage and I can throw myself back into the work with ease then. But yes, when the writing is happening, it takes over life, and is very intense.</p>
<p>Darrell - Where do you get your inspiration?</p>
<p>Ricki - This is weirdly funny, because in ‘real life’ I’m a very gentle person, adoring and nurturing my 4 kids, caring about the environment … BUT … I’ve had a life-long interest in the psychology of serial killers, and have a great knowledge of them. This inspires me, and it’s the psychology, not the violence, that I am trying to get across in my work. I have to put the violence into the books, readers of the type of novel I produce like that (although a recent reviewer said he’d never known so many murders in one book!). Life, just looking around, people watching, that’s a great way to find inspiration if you let your mind wander.</p>
<p>Darrell - What sort of marketing do you think is best for a writer?</p>
<p>Ricki - Slow with lots of patience. A writers’ life is full of rejection. Get the first book out there, Facebook is a wonderful marketing tool and the majority of writers are happy to support each other with the ‘ups and downs’, and I believe (perhaps it’s the Brit in me) that you should be self-deprecating, let the work stand for itself. If it’s good enough, then the success will happen gently.</p>
<p>Darrell - What are you currently working on?</p>
<p>Ricki - I recently finished Bloody Mary, which is somewhat on the theme of Hope’s Vengeance, and I’m currently working on Bonfire Night, another one about a serial killer, albeit covering several years as opposed to Unlikely Killer’s intense rampage. Also Holiday of the Dead, an anthology of zombie stories, has just been released and luckily one of my stories (Ladykiller) is included. And I continuously have a stream of journalistic articles appearing in both national and local magazines and newsletters.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you see as the future of hard copy books as opposed to ebooks?</p>
<p>Ricki - Whoah, the divided subject! I personally love the feel of a ‘real’ book in my hands, but many people adore Kindle, and I have to admit that most of my sales are through Kindle even though the book’s available in hard copy. As a writer, the sales are great, but at 69pence a book, sadly the royalties don’t pay the bills. I suspect the future is electronic, it appears to be the most economic way of getting hours of enjoyment from a novel, but from an authors view, it will reduce the industry to writing as a hobby rather than a job.</p>

<p>William Campbell &#8211; Writing Persistence Leads to Amazon Top 100</p>
<p>Success has not come overnight for William Campbell. It took the author nine years to complete his Dead Forever trilogy. I interviewed William when one of his books made it to the top one hundred books on the Kindle Free Bestseller list.</p>
<p>He spoke about what led to the writing of the series and his advice for anyone trying to succeed as a writer.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you want to become a writer?</p>
<p>William - Often, I rather imagine it chose me. I can’t even recall ever wanting to “be a writer.” I wanted to tell a story, and becoming a writer was the means to do so. Of course, that opened the door to other stories wanting to be told, and the hard work of learning the craft began. In all truth, being a writer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It’s grueling work and the pay is rotten, considering the hours invested. But for those of us with a tale gnawing at our thoughts, writing is a form of therapy. Of course, one could simply write journals in that case, but the ultimate resolution to our internal need to share only comes when another is included. And for that to happen, the writing needs to surpass the quality of a journal. By using dramatic structure, a novelist blends their need to express themselves with an entertaining story that carries the reader along. When we get it right, the reader is rewarded, and so are we. Everybody wins.</p>
<p>Darrell - I believe it took you nine years to complete your Dead Forever trilogy. How did you keep up the interest in the project?</p>
<p>William - Life has a nasty habit of getting in the way. Yes, it did take many years, for a number of reasons, but keeping interested in the project was never a problem. Making time to work on it was the bigger problem. But looking back now, I doubt it would have happened any faster, even if I had all the time in the world. Dead Forever is an intricate puzzle that even I had to figure out along the way. It took those years for all the pieces of the puzzle to surface, and my patience with the project has resulted in a mind-bender sure to delight readers who reach the trilogy’s conclusion. I did, of course, work on other projects along the way, but none of those will see the light of day. We’ll call those “practice,” and the lessons learned were saved for Dead Forever.</p>
<p>There are different ways to approach the job of novelist, and there isn’t one right way. Some authors pour out titles and publish them. I admire these folks for their ability to produce good work in so little time. On the other hand, there’s the rest of us who pour out titles and dump them because they suck. Then one day, we finally get what we feel is right, and publish it. Now reaching that point, I’m hoping my productivity increases.</p>
<p>Darrell - The first book in the series is currently on the top 100 Free Kindle ebooks. How did you manage this fantastic feat?</p>
<p>William - That is difficult to say, other than free is a very good price. Awakening has been on Amazon for 17 months and only recently went on sale at the sweet price of $0.00. It proceeded to climb and peaked at #18, but has since slipped some, not really a surprise, though it did linger for a good time at #1 in Science Fiction. When peddling wares in the Amazon frontier, success equals more success. Once a title gets higher in the lists, it gets more visibility and sells better. And again, free is a very good price. The key is getting there to begin with, and to sustain downloads by having an eye-catching cover and an intriguing blurb. Of course, the quality between the covers is equally important in selling subsequent titles, which is the entire reason for offering the first title for free. This, I can report, is working. Sales of the second and third books (not free) have surged.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you think writers should best market themselves?</p>
<p>William - First of all, be polite and respectful online. But before that, do the hard work and make a great product. Then make a few more, and build a catalog of titles. Then give one away, a means for potential readers to sample your wares at no obligation. Those who like the work (not everyone will) are the folks who will come back for more. That’s where the catalog of titles comes in, the “more.”</p>
<p>Now, back to polite and respectful, and an author’s online presence. Always be a writer, not only when writing your novels. Apparently (that I have witnessed), some aspiring authors fail to realize that each time they post their words to the internet, for one thing, those words live forever. And being a writer, every post we make is a sample of our work. Make your net communications as elegant as your novels. Think of your internet posts as an audition.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the future is for hard copy books now that ebooks are here?</p>
<p>William - Don’t believe everything you read on the internet (including anything I have to say). In my opinion, the death of print is highly exaggerated. Today, printed books remain the primary revenue stream that sustains the commercial publishing trade, and I predict it will remain so far into the future. The number of ebooks sold each year is certainly growing at a fantastic rate, but some folks fail to consider that those numbers do not necessarily represent lost sales of print editions. Readership has increased due to ebooks, meaning people who were buying few printed books in the past are buying ebooks by the truckload because of the convenience and attractive prices. After nearly four decades in the printing industry myself (my day job), I can speak from experience. The printed page is here to stay, though certainly fewer pages thanks to the information age. I believe ebooks are best suited to transient fiction (read once, here today gone tomorrow). Non-fiction and selected fiction with lasting quality will continue as ink on paper for years to come. For works of fiction that a reader loves enough to revisit, nothing beats owning a printed copy on the bookshelf.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone trying to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>William - Write, write, and write some more. Then edit and proofread, rewrite, rewrite, and rewrite. And hire an editor. Have patience, do the hard work, and produce the best product you can. All the marketing in the world does little good if the reader opens the book and is disappointed with the writing. Step one is to make a good book.</p>
<p>One piece of advice that I often question is the suggestion that authors should read a great deal of fiction, even bad fiction, as if that would teach one how to write better by observing what not to do. I fail to see any logic in this. If one yearns to be a gold-medalist in the Olympic games, watching other athletes fall down has little value. One must practice, practice, and practice more, until a high level of craft is achieved and technique is refined. For authors that translates to write, write, and write some more. Then write even more. Reading the work of others does little to improve a novelist’s talent. A better use of an author’s non-writing time is to absorb non-fiction pertaining to the craft of writing. A favorite of mine is the Art of Fiction by John Gardner, in which I learned the principle of the Fictive Dream, a vital component of any novel.</p>

<p>Debbi Mack &#8211; Book Cracks New York Times Bestseller List</p>
<p>Debbi Mack is a hardboiled crime writer &#8211; which is probably what studying and practicing law for twelve years will do to you. When I interviewed Debbi, she had written a number of books including two in the Sam McRae series.</p>
<p>Debbie also has a Master of Library Science degree which means that she&#8217;s good with both a book and a gun.</p>
<p>Darrell - What’s a typical day of writing like for you?</p>
<p>Debbi - To the extent any day is typical, I suppose it’s generally structured to that take care of marketing and administrative matters first. Once I have those out of the way, I usually set aside anywhere from two to four hours to do research and/or writing on my work in progress. Occasionally, the opportunity will arise to work on a short story or even a script. Now and then, I’ve managed to pull one of those together, while still working on a novel. I’ve tried, but find it difficult to work on two novels simultaneously. I have no idea how other writers manage to do it.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you want to become a writer and how did it happen?</p>
<p>Debbi - I don’t know if it’s genetic or my upbringing, but I’ve always wanted to be a writer. I think if you’d handed me a pencil after I emerged from the womb, I’d have probably started scribbling a story about what it was like to be born. I think writers are people who simply have the innate urge to communicate in some form or other. In the case of fiction writers, the urge is to tell stories. Where does this comes from? Most likely from reading them, I think. Perhaps from hearing them, too. My mother used to tell us bedtime stories. Sometimes oral bedtime tales, actually. Do mothers still do this? Is oral storytelling still alive and well? Just wondering.</p>
<p>Darrell - Mystery books often seem to lead the list of ebook sellers. Do you think certain genres have an advantage in relation to ebook sales?</p>
<p>Debbi - All good storytelling involves the element of suspense in some fashion. Suspense is an element inherent to the mystery and thriller genres. Therefore, by virtue of being genres that require a necessary element of fiction in order to work at all, mysteries and thrillers have an advantage over other genres that might get by with other less compelling plot devices. At least, that’s my theory.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your books are for sale for only 99 cents and you’re up there rubbing shoulders on Amazon with Jonathan Kellerman and Mary Higgins Clark. How important is pricing?</p>
<p>Debbi - Extremely important, particularly for a new and unknown author such as myself. For good or ill, after your book is written, it becomes a product. As such your name is the book’s brand. My name isn’t Sue Grafton or John Grisham or Stieg Larsson, which is to say I’m not highly recognizable. I once made a comparison on my blog between my book and a can of peas. The ones with Libby on the label, people are willing to pay more for. The generic kind, not so much. Even if the peas are just as good. Unfortunately, at this stage of the game, my name is not yet well enough established for my books to be perceived as being much more than “generic” mysteries. Hopefully, as more people read the books and become familiar with my writing, this will change. I know for some readers, this is already true. With any luck, word of mouth will help to establish my name more firmly as a brand and, at some point, I’ll get more comfortable with raising the price of my books. For right now, this price point is working for me. And if it ain’t broke, why fix it, right? :)</p>
<p>Darrell - Do you have any advice about marketing and how you get yourself known out there?</p>
<p>Debbi - There are so many ways to market, the choices can be overwhelming. The first thing to do is sit down and plan your marketing strategy. Think about where your readers hang around online and focus your marketing toward those places, if possible. Among those places, is there a blog or list where you can write a post, be interviewed or have your book reviewed? Every time you get an interview, guest post or review posted online, be sure to blog about it. Oh, did I mention you’ll want to have a blog? (I have five, but I’m an idiot. :)) Also, get on Twitter and Facebook. You’ll want to tweet all your blog posts and post them to Facebook. Twitter, in particular, is a most powerful tool for reaching readers and engaging with them, as well as promoting and marketing your work. My advice on Twitter: follow pretty much anyone who isn’t a bot or a spammer. You never know where it might lead. All sorts of people hang out on Twitter. And it’s just awesome in general. Do more than talk about yourself. Engage with others. Retweet fun and interesting stuff. Say meaningful or silly things. Just be there, play nice, spread the word and all will be well.</p>
<p>Find ways to cross-promote your work with other authors. For example, my first novel IDENTITY CRISIS includes an excerpt from Joe Konrath’s THE LIST at the end. In exchange, Joe includes an excerpt from my novel at the end of THE LIST.</p>
<p>Along with building a strong following on Twitter and following people back, you can greatly enhance your book’s visibility through the occasional use of online promotional book launches. The idea is to provide an incentive of some sort for people to purchase the book on a particular date, thus boosting the rank with a particular goal, e.g., reaching the Top 100 in Paid Kindle. Even if the goal isn’t met, the effort can have a marked long-term salutary effect on the book’s rank and sales.</p>
<p>Paid sponsorships with Kindle Nation Daily, the Frugal eReader and other similar sites are also well worth considering.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for writers who are trying to get their first novel published?</p>
<p>Debbi - For the purposes of your question, I’m assuming the novel is written and as ready for publication as you can make it. At this point, you have two choices: 1) try to get it published through traditional means either by finding an agent who brokers a deal with a large publisher or making a deal on your own directly with a small publisher; or 2) self-publish the book, market and sell it yourself.</p>
<p>At one time, the conventional wisdom was that choosing the second option was tantamount to career suicide. This is no longer the case. In fact, self-publishing has become a highly desirable, if not preferable option for fiction writers. However, keep in mind, it isn’t an easier way to succeed as an author.</p>
<p>The only way to achieve success in this business is to work hard and write the best story of which you’re capable. Since people have to know about your book before they’ll buy it, you have to tell them about it. So, whether you land a traditional publishing deal or self-publish your book, be prepared to market and promote your work. Develop a marketing and promotional strategy and do a little bit every day (see marketing tips above). In addition, keep writing. Move onto your next project. The work doesn’t stop with just one novel. Not if you intend to write for a living. Rinse and repeat. :)</p>

<p>James LePore &#8211; Free Kindle Ebook hits Amazon Number One</p>
<p>James LePore enjoyed a long career in the legal profession before selling up and taking up writing. When I interviewed him, he was the author of three books including his recently released &#8220;Sons and Princes&#8221;.</p>
<p>His newest novel is entitled Gods and Fathers.</p>
<p>Darrell - You were a lawyer for twenty-five years. What made you become a writer?</p>
<p>James - In 1982 my father died after a twelve month struggle with lung cancer. I was practicing law then, but reading novels at the rate of two or three a week, something I had been doing since I was thirteen. My response to my father&#8217;s sickness and death was to write a novel, which I titled That Archangels May Come In. The experience was cathartic of course, but the interesting thing to me, looking back, was that I chose to tell a long story (about a fictional young lawyer losing his father to lung cancer) as the means of that catharsis. Why write a novel? Because, I realized, novels had become as much a part of me as my skeletal system, they were the bones of my intellectual and imaginative life.</p>
<p>Archangels was badly written. One professional reviewer said that it was predictable and cliched, and he was being kind. But it was a start. It got me thinking. I wanted to write a good novel, I wanted what was in my bones to appear on the printed page, the published printed page. In 1999, I sold my law practice so that I could write full time.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe how you create your novels i.e. do you plot them beforehand or let them evolve?</p>
<p>James - I start with two things, the name of my central character and a predicament that he or she is in. It may sound odd, but I believe that much of a person&#8217;s destiny is in his or her name. I am therefore careful to pick the right name, something that speaks to me of character and the intangibles, like courage and perseverance and hidden complexities.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you promote your books?</p>
<p>James - I am on Facebook and Twitter.  I send out a monthly James LePore Fiction eNewsletter. I do readings at book stores and at people&#8217;s homes. I have met many great book bloggers who have been kind enough to review my books.</p>
<p>Darrell - What does a typical day of writing entail for you?</p>
<p>James - I get up early and write for four or five hours. After that my brain is worn out so I do something that doesn&#8217;t involve too much thinking.</p>
<p>Darrell - There is some variety in the pricing of your Kindle ebooks. How did all this come about?</p>
<p>James - My publisher, The Story Plant, has decided to catch the free eBook wave, believing, I think rightly, that a giveaway will get many, many people to read my books who otherwise would not have. The idea also is to generate goodwill among book lovers for my other novels. My first novel, &#8216;A World I Never Made,&#8217; has been available for a free eBook download, all platforms, since April 5. It is now number one on Amazon free Kindle. The promotion ends on April 19. After that all three of my novels will be $3.99 on Amazon for Kindle and everywhere else online. We are living in a very tough economy where people need to justify almost everything they buy, books included. We think these prices are very fair and hope to see lots and lots of downloads.</p>
<p>Darrell - Writers can now self publish their own books if they choose. Where do you see the publishing business heading over the next ten years i.e. are we still going to be reading paperbacks ten years from now?</p>
<p>James - I believe that the eReader will from now on be accepted as the way to receive their daily bread by readers of both fiction and non-fiction. Packaging is nice, but in the end it&#8217;s content, not packaging, that sustains a reader&#8217;s soul. Reader&#8217;s will always love to read, but in today&#8217;s very hectic world (and very scary economy), I believe they will be willing to sacrifice packaging in exchange for the great pricing and the tremendous simplicity and ease of purchase and delivery that comes with an eReader.</p>
<p>This is not to say that print books will go away. They will, I believe, fall into a different, and more exalted category, that of the prized possession. Remember, I said daily bread, not gourmet meal. There will be readers&#8212;many, many of them&#8212;who will love a book so much that they will have to own it as an artifact, an icon of their experience of reading it. This desire for the physical thing may arise after reading an e-book, or by simply knowing that certain books have to be on your shelf near the fireplace, Jane Austen, for example, or Hemingway or Stieg Larrson. Publishers may respond by printing limited special editions, beautifully bound, perhaps signed by the author, treasures to be cared for, handed down, read aloud to the children.</p>
<p>As this new model expands, traditional print publishers are going to have to rethink their missions, while at the same time self-publishing and other models&#8212;most of them not even thought of at the moment&#8212;will have more room to position themselves than ever dreamed possible. I can see five writers getting together, for example, to form their own e-publishing company. I say go for it. Keep all the profits!</p>

<p>Stephen Carpenter &#8211; Entertainment Weekly calls Killer an “ebook blockbuster”</p>
<p>Stephen Carpenter has worked as a screenwriter on movies such as Ocean’s Eleven, Blue Streak, The Man and Dean Koontz’s Servants of Twilight. When I interviewed Stephen, he had begun work on a one hour mini-series for NBC. He has since released his new book, Killer in the Hills, which is the next book in the &#8220;Killer&#8221; series on Amazon. His book, The Grimm Curse which was the basis for the NBC series Grimm, is also available.</p>
<p>In this interview, he spoke about his adventures in ebook publishing.</p>
<p>Darrell - You studied screenwriting at UCLA. What made you decide to be a storyteller?</p>
<p>Stephen - I was an obsessive reader when I was a kid. I wanted to be a novelist as a child, before I discovered the movies. Then, once I got interested in filmmaking, I started watching movies constantly, the way I used to read. I gravitated toward screenwriting because the movies I loved most were the ones with truly remarkable writing–the Godfathers, Chinatown, Don’t Look Now, etc., etc. I was a very annoying moviegoing companion. I was always picking up story holes and weak characterizations. So I just started reading screenplays and eventually started writing them, on my own. Movies are expensive to make, but it costs nothing to write a script, so I felt I had nothing to lose by trying.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve worked both as a screenwriter and a director. How does your knowledge of screenwriting influence your novel writing?</p>
<p>Stephen - Screenwriting is all about story and character. There’s little room for prose. The story’s the thing. That discipline made me brutal in pushing the story along in a novel. My first drafts are usually very short–just story and character. The detail comes later. My heroes are writers like Robert Parker, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Ernest Hemingway, James M. Cain, etc. All writers whose prose is very spare and, not coincidentally, all of them worked at some point as screenwriters.</p>
<p>Darrell - Killer has been sitting in the top 100 Kindle books for some time now. To what do you attribute your success?</p>
<p>Stephen - Good timing, Amazon’s amazing promotion machine, and the customer reviews. People who love to read are flocking to the ebooks under $5, so any decent book under five bucks will at least get a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Darrell - What sort of marketing do you focus on for your books?</p>
<p>Stephen - None whatsoever. I published Killer on Amazon as a lark and Amazon did the rest. I set up a blog but I think I’ve had a total of five visitors. My best guess is that there must have been a lot of word of mouth about the book. I was surprised when sales kept rising, and shocked two weeks ago when I saw a blurb in Entertainment Weekly calling Killer an “ebook blockbuster.” A lot of my friends didn’t even know I had written a book.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can we expect to see Jack Rhodes (from Killer) or Jake Grimm (from The Grimm Curse) in any sequels?</p>
<p>Stephen - You bet. I am halfway through the second Killer book, and Jack is already in big trouble. My goal is to continue the Killer series for as long as Parker’s Spenser series. Screenwriting gave me a tough work ethic, so I think I can write two books a year, give or take. I plan to publish the second Killer in June.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone who has just self-published their first ebook?</p>
<p>Stephen - I certainly can’t give any marketing or promotion advice, since I’ve never done any. I would say be open to revisions, even after you have published the book. After Killer had been on Amazon for a few weeks, I noticed some customer reviews that referenced some criticisms of certain aspects of the book. So I un-published it, worked on it for a couple of weeks, then re-published it and the reviews improved. It’s a remarkable advantage for e-authors–to have a completely objective, randomly selected group of readers who freely offer what amounts to great editorial advice, even if it’s sometimes hard to hear. Believe in your work but be prepared to be brutal with it.</p>

<p>Kat Martin &#8211; Over Fifty Published Novels and Still Writing</p>
<p>Kat Martin is a New York Times Bestselling author. She has written over fifty romance novels including the Necklace series, the Heart Trilogy and the Bride Trilogy. When I interviewed her, she had just released her book, A Song for my Mother.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you become a writer?</p>
<p>Kat - I started writing after my husband had written a western novel. I thought it might be fun to try writing a book myself. I had lots of stories rolling around in my head. I picked one out and started. It took me a year and half to finish. The book was MAGNIFICENT PASSAGE. It&#8217;s being re-issued in July of this year with a gorgeous new cover.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve written more than fifty novels. Can you describe your process of writing a book?</p>
<p>Kat - I write about four long days a week. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I go to the gym in the morning, come home and do whatever promo we are doing for the book that is next to be released or is currently on the shelves. I start with a story concept and expand as much as I can before I start the actual writing.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your husband is also a writer. Is it helpful having another writer in the house?</p>
<p>Kat - Extremely helpful to have another writer in the house. Larry is great for reading the pages I&#8217;ve written or helping me develop action sequences or just plain helping me work out the plot. He reads a lot of my stuff, looks for errors.</p>
<p>Darrell - There seems to be some bias against popular fiction writers. Why do you think this is?</p>
<p>Kat - Maybe they&#8217;re jealous because we make more money! Just kidding. But there is a degree of jealousy involved. Literary writers consider their writing to be of a much higher caliber. I think it is just a different style of writing.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the future is for hard copy books now that ebooks are becoming so popular?</p>
<p>Kat - It&#8217;s still nice to own a physical copy of a book. I find it easier to discuss a book that is actually in my hand, say for a readers&#8217; group or to use as a reference. Plus it is extremely difficult to find a good book just by perusing the Internet. Going into a bookstore and looking at the book itself seems to be the key, download it after that. I can&#8217;t imagine they will totally stop making printed books.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think the secret is to succeed as a writer?</p>
<p>Kat - The key to success is perseverance. It takes drive and guts to finish a book. The trick is getting it published, taking the hard knocks of rejection without losing your self-confidence. You have to persevere in order to make it in the publishing world.</p>

<p>Stephen Knight &#8211; Self Discipline a Key to Writing Success</p>
<p>Stephen lives in the New York City area. He is the author of a number of novels including the bestselling book, The Gathering Dead. In this interview he spoke about how he became a writer and how self discipline has helped him to produce quality books that people are buying. He also discusses the pros and cons of the 0.99 cent price bracket.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you become a writer?</p>
<p>Stephen - Why, The Six Million Dollar Man of course! I was about eleven or twelve when that show first came out, and I really wanted to emulate the things I saw on the TV screen. Obviously not being bionic (or even very athletic), lifting cars and sprinting at 60 miles an hour and the like was a bit of a stretch. So I found my dad’s old typewriter–and it was a job from the 1950s, I think–grabbed some paper, and started writing Steve Austin adventures. With regrets to the writer whose novel started it all, Martin Caidin. I really just never stopped since.</p>
<p>Other influences: Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Ben Bova, Tom Clancy, David Brin, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (Lucifier’s Hammer remains incredibly good even 34 years later), Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Peter Straub, Robert Crais, Jamie Ford, Tony Hillerman, Michael Connelly, James Ellroy, Jack Chalker… heck, I’ve even got some Danielle Steel books in my library.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve written across a number of genres including horror. Is there a particular genre you are going to focus on in the future?</p>
<p>Stephen - Well, I do have a “hit list” of projects I’ll be working on. Right now, I’m finishing an international thriller. After that, I have an action-adventure book, and then the sequel to The Gathering Dead. Then the next two Hackett novellas. I’ve had ideas for several police procedurals that I want to start putting to paper this summer, and there are two more horror books that I want to write. I even have a piece of commercial fiction that’s about one quarter complete, though I’ve shelved that for now. The only thing I don’t actively have in the works is a science fiction piece, which is odd, since SF is my first love. But for some reason, I just can’t do that genre justice now.</p>
<p>So I see I’ve not directly answered your question… I’m spread out, but I see more opportunities for me to write horror and adventure over the course of the next year.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Stephen - I’ve actually become much more disciplined. When it’s time for me to write, I write no less than 2,500 to 3,000 words. If I have to put off sleep, I do it. If I have to leave the TV off, I do it. I’m in the process of finishing the first draft of the thriller I mentioned earlier, and I expect to generate 20,000-30,000 words this week. Before I started self-publishing, I severely lacked that discipline. That changed after the first story went up, a hard-boiled piece called Family Ties. I’ve been extremely fixated on generating product, and that of course means I have to achieve a credible word count on a daily basis. I tried it the other way–writing whenever the muse struck–for decades, and it did not work. I’m playing a different game this time. At 3,000 words a day, I can generate a short novel in ten days. Output is part of the recipe for success.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your books are priced at that magical 0.99 cents. What do you perceive as being the bonuses and negatives for being in this price bracket?</p>
<p>Stephen - Bonuses - folks will pick up your title on a whim, and if they enjoy it, they’ll be more inclined to make another selection from your offerings. Obviously right now, that’s what’s fueling the ascent of The Gathering Dead on the horror list, and right now it’s hovering between #15 and #20. I am picking up some good reviews, and in the product forums, I find people are discussing it in generally favourable terms. I’m not sure I would have the benefit of these at a higher price point. Fewer people would buy it, and for sure it wouldn’t be elevating on the horror list. So at .99 cents, exposure is not a problem.</p>
<p>Negatives - Well, at .35 cents a unit sold, that’s not a bucket load of money, is it? $2.99 is a much more pleasant price point because it’s a bit more fair across the board–the reader isn’t shelling out 9.99 for an eBook, and the writer is actually receiving a couple of bucks per sale, not just .35 cents. But I don’t think the returns should be a dwelling point, at least not for me. John Locke makes what, a hundred grand a month on .35 cents per unit? He’s a very special case in that he’s developed an eminently marketable character with Donovan Creed that a lot of readers automatically “get”, so he doesn’t have to worry about selling the product to an audience, that audience knows what they want and they found it in John’s stories. Honestly, if he were to raise the prices of his offerings to $1.99 or $2.99, it would be less catastrophic for him than it would be for me to raise the price on The Gathering Dead. So another negative of riding the .99 cent merry-go-round? Fear you’ll lose everything if you bump the price!</p>
<p>Darrell - Horror has sometimes received a bit of a bad rap over the years. What are your thoughts on the old debate of ‘violent media makes people do violent things’?</p>
<p>Stephen - You know, I’m a native Texan, but my mother isn’t your stereotypical Texas lady. She hates guns, fears them terribly. When I was a kid, I wasn’t allowed to have any toy guns at all. So when I’d play with my friends and we’d do Cowboys and Indians (ah, the less PC days of the 1960s!) or Army Soldiers, I was the only guy without a gun. All my friends had pistols and rifles that would shot those little red paper caps. Me, I’d run around pointing my index finger while going, “Pow, pow, pow!” My mother would see this and yell at me to stop, fearing that I’d grow up to become a serial killer. Shoot, I can’t even kill a box of cereal anymore, so her fears were definitely unfounded.</p>
<p>Today, what with the TV shows, the movies, the console games, etc., more folks are exposed to violent imagery than ever before. But I’m unconvinced that exposure is responsible for the outbreaks of violence we see on the news. Too many folks are looking for external culprits, things that can be controlled and sanitized to protect society. But the fact is, a well-balanced human being is created in the home. Doesn’t matter if it’s a single parent household, a traditional household, a non-traditional household… so long as the appropriate values are taught and reinforced, I can’t imagine someone would unwind the moment they catch a Resident Evil movie. Human beings just aren’t that fragile. The folks who perpetrate acts of violence against the rest of us have somehow found a way around that internal censor that prohibits the rest of us from doing what these characters do. Don&#8217;t get me wrong–it would be way cool to drill six rounds of .45 ACP through the hood of that BMW 550 that cut me off, but I&#8217;m certain the following jail time would dull the lustre.</p>
<p>Almost all of us are exposed to the same literature, imagery, and circumstances over the course of our lives. A small percentage of us act out in a way that’s anti-social and legitimately dangerous. If horror and violent fiction was responsible for that, then Blake Crouch’s excellent book RUN would be a historical text as opposed to a road block that&#8217;s preventing my book from achieving Top 10 glory, damn it!</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have for someone starting out as a writer, in terms of promoting themselves and getting noticed in the marketplace?</p>
<p>Stephen - Ah, promotion! They toughest thing about this entire endeavour is getting the word out and making yourself stand out from the pack. My approach has been this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write a good story.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Edit that story. Typos and misspellings are not just embarrassing in the professional arena, they make you look like an ass.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have as many people as possible read that story, then adjust it to address the common issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Come up with a good cover. If you can afford it, hire someone. If not, develop the skills yourself. A good cover is key.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A good product description. I’m horrible at these, and actually have others help me out. This is just as important as the cover.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The boards and the rest of the internet… your blog or web site, Kindleboards, Twitter, GoodReads, anywhere you have established an online presence, milk it for what it’s worth. Other than taking out an ad in the New York Times Book Review, this is about the best advertising you’re going to get. (And for those who think an ad in the NYT Book Review is something to consider, I did too. Regrettably, the lowest price is $2,800 for a one-time ad that is 1/20th of a page in size. I can’t consider that a cost-effective outlay.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Approach folks to review your books. There are a lot of literary review sites out there. Find the ones that cater to your target audience and hit them up for reviews. Most will do it for free, but it takes weeks to get a review up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be a good sport. Invariably, someone will disparage your work and take you to task for it. Don’t roll onto target with guns blazing. Be as gracious about it as you can be, even if the altercation happens on a message board where everyone can see it. You’re offering something no one has to buy, and you won’t move many units being a contentious fool who castigates folks who don’t properly respect the fruit of your mental loins. Never do this. You always want to be the good guy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to say that my approach has been working out all right so far, but I&#8217;m always on the lookout for a new opportunity. Things are changing in favour of the self-pubbed writer bit by bit, so there will soon be more avenues available to exploit. Not all of them will be free, of course!</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me in, and I hope I didn&#8217;t make too much of a mess.</p>

<p>Sara Rosett &#8211; Connect with Readers through Facebook, Twitter and Goodreads</p>
<p>Being the wife of an Air Force husband and being forced to move on a regular basis might prove an insurmountable obstacle for some people. But you know that old saying about turning lemons into lemonade? That&#8217;s exactly what Sara Rosett has done. When I interviewed Sara, she had already written six books about a mystery solving Air Force wife &#8211; and it still looks like there&#8217;s no end in sight.</p>
<p>The first book in the series, Moving is Murder, was a Reader’s Choice Award Nominee in 2007 at the Salt Lake County Library and received a Distinguished Honor Award from the Military Writers Society of America.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’ve been an army wife for several years and your character Ellie Avery has a similar background. Should writers write what they know?</p>
<p>Sara - I feel more comfortable writing about an arena I’m familiar with, so that’s why I used my experiences as a military spouse (Air Force spouse, actually!) as background for the book. I have a tendency to get lost in research and since I was writing about a lifestyle I knew inside and out I didn’t get bogged down in research. I don’t think the “write what you know” should be a hard and fast rule for writers. You should write about whatever you’re passionate about and if there are gaps in your knowledge that’s okay–that’s what research is for! I knew about moving, deployments, and squadron politics, but I had no idea about poison, guns, murder methods, requirements for search warrants, and law enforcement jurisdictions, so there was plenty of stuff I had to learn about to write my mysteries.</p>
<p>Darrell - How long does it normally take you to write a novel?</p>
<p>Sara - When I’m working on the first draft, I write for about two or three hours and then I’m pretty brain dead and have to take a break. It usually takes me about three to four months to finish the first draft. I always begin with the first chapter and write straight through to the end. I’ve never been good at revising as I go. I lose sight of the big picture and lose momentum, so I save the revisions until after I’ve finished the first draft. The revisions take about a month, sometimes longer. (This is a best case senario. I’ve certainly had it take longer!)</p>
<p>Darrell - You mention on your website that you “don’t outline, but use a graphic organizer when I’m writing a synopsis.” What exactly does this involve?</p>
<p>Sara - I tried to outline and found that I don’t think in such an orderly, linear way. What works best for me is a large blank sheet of butcher paper. I write down the basics of the story:  the victim, the murderer, and how the murder is accomplished. Then I brainstorm, jotting down ideas about who could be suspects and why they would be involved with this set of characters with lines and arrows connecting different people in the story. In the end, it usually looks pretty jumbled, but it works for me. I’ve also used notecards to write down scene ideas, but lately I’ve switched to keeping notes in my manuscripts of what scenes I need to write next or what changes I need to go back and make.</p>
<p>Darrell - You’re now six books into your series. Do you see an end or want to move onto a different writing project?</p>
<p>Sara - I love writing about Ellie and revisiting characters from previous books, so I’m happy to continue the series.</p>
<p>I’m writing the seventh Ellie book now and there is currently one more under contract. There was a point–I think I was a little burned out–when I thought I was completely out of stories for Ellie, but then an idea popped into my head and I thought, “Yeah, I could make that work.” The ideas keep coming and I keep filing them away for future books. I have ideas for other stories, other characters, I’d like to write. Those are on the back burner right now, but I hope to delve into them soon. In particular, I’m thinking of writing a historical mystery.</p>
<p>Darrell - What are some of the lessons you’ve learnt about the publishing business?</p>
<p>Sara - I’ve learned that there is only so much I can do to promote my books. When my first book came out, I did everything I could think of to promote it–book signings at bookstores and base exchanges; I made t-shirts; I ran book giveaway contests; I even snagged a few local television interviews and articles in local newspapers. I attended conferences and blogged and targeted niche markets with my press releases. I’m sure all those things helped, but I think I went a little overboard. It’s hard not to when your first book comes out!</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve decided that I should spend the majority of my time writing the best books I can. Instead of doing tons of individual signings, I’ve joined The Deadly Divas. We’re a group of four mystery authors and we do a book tour once or twice a year. It’s much easier to generate buzz and interest, not to mention more fun, to promote our books together. E-books are changing everything and I’m not sure signings will be such a good outlet for promotion in a few years. I’m also concentrating on on-line promotion and connecting with readers through Facebook, Twitter, Goodreads, and reader discussion forums.</p>
<p>Darrell - What advice would you have in terms of marketing for someone just about to release their first novel?</p>
<p>Sara - I’d say, first, enjoy it! It’s a wonderful feeling to have your first book out–savor it. Second, find a way to connect with your readers. It might be at conferences or through on-line discussion groups or something unrelated to books. I know one author who sells her craft-themed mysteries at craft fairs. Don’t try and do everything (like I did!). I’d also recommend joint promotion. Get together with a few authors who write books similar to yours. It’s much easier to draw attention to you and your books if you’re in a group.</p>
<p>I’ve always had bookmarks printed so that I have something to hand out at signings and give to people who I meet who are interested in my books. (I use Iconix.biz.) Writers conferences and reader conventions usually put together “goody bags” for attendees and they’re usually looking for donations of promotional materials.</p>

<p>Patricia Gragg &#8211; Facebook and Twitter Relationships Led to Bestseller Status</p>
<p>Patricia Gragg is one of those writers who has achieved the enviable status of having a book on the Amazon bestseller list. In this interview she spoke about how she achieved this wonderful success as well as the process involved in self publishing your own ebooks.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Patricia - Like most writers, I started early. In the 2nd or 3rd grade, I wrote plays and made my brother and the neighbourhood kids perform them in our garage. I wrote short stories and even began novels in grade school. After school, I worked at a variety of jobs in public relations and submitted poems and stories to The Atlantic and The New Yorker. I even received some encouraging replies (which I’ve saved). I decided to go back to school and enrolled at Wichita State University which has a creative writing department, and that became my home. I finished my BA and two years of graduate school. I worked with Hilma Wolitzer and Doris Betts, among others, and James Lee Burke was my adviser. Those were wonderful years.</p>
<p>Afterward, I worked as a technical writer and wrote several novels which I submitted to the top publishers without any results. I was always in a writing group. Then came ebooks!</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Patricia - I think about what I need to do on my story while I have coffee and breakfast. When I’m finally at my computer, I go back and read the last three or four chapters I’ve written. This leads to editing and making little fixes. I just gradually slip into continuing the story. Eventually I take a break and take care of my email plus go to Facebook and Twitter to see what’s going on.</p>
<p>In the evening, after I’ve taken care of other responsibilities, I may go back and start the whole process over. I also run the story through my mind at night, before I go to sleep. Or when I’m driving, or waiting in the doctor’s office, or watching a TV show.</p>
<p>Darrell - Many people who are about to self publish their own ebook are curious about the process you go through to do this. Can you describe how this works with Smashwords and Kindle and the other online retailers?</p>
<p>Patricia - Basically, I logged on to the Smashwords site and followed the link to their directions for self publishing. I had to reformat my manuscript and then upload it to their ‘Meatgrinder,’ a program which formats the manuscript for several different outlets. Then I previewed it, went back and made a few changes in the formatting, and uploaded it again.</p>
<p>Amazon is much the same except a little more complicated. The formatting in the finished product looks pretty good. Like Smashwords, you can preview and make changes until you’re satisfied. And there you are, a published author with your words available to the world!</p>
<p>I haven’t uploaded to other online retailers although I wish I had. The royalties would be higher.</p>
<p>Darrell - Your book, The Rose Killer, is one of the bestselling ebooks on Kindle. How did you achieve this amazing feat?</p>
<p>Patricia - I’ve been asked this question by several of my author friends. I wish I had the answer. Basically, I developed a lot of friendships on Facebook and Twitter, which included readers and other authors. I did some self promotion and tried to help other writers. I was active on Goodreads and uploaded my book there. I also met some interesting people.</p>
<p>I created a website, which didn’t see many visitors until recently. I did not create a blog. In short, I did what most aspiring writers do. I’d really love to say that my book made the top 100 because it’s so great. Of course, I think it’s good, but I’m pretty sure that something (appearance on a list, perhaps) made the book visible to the public.</p>
<p>I’m still amazed.</p>

<p>Michele Scott &#8211; Rejection From Major Publisher Created Ebook Success</p>
<p>Michele Scott is a successful writer who wears many different faces. Her Nikki Sands mysteries are set on vineyards. She writes these under her own name while she writes thriller novels under the name A K Alexander. After many years of trying to succeed as an author, she is now well on the road to writing success.</p>
<p>Her books &#8220;Mommy, May I?&#8221; and &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s Home&#8221; have both been on the Kindle bestseller list. In this interview she spoke about her writing and how past rejection from a publisher led to her current success as an ebook writer.</p>
<p>Darrell - After writing your first book which you described on your site as “pretty darn bad”, it took you twelve years to become a published author. What were you doing during that twelve year period?</p>
<p>Michele - I was writing books (7 total and as many or more partials), raising a family, and working my day job for our family business where we manufacture sports medicine products for horses.</p>
<p>Darrell - Can you describe a typical day of writing?</p>
<p>Michele - Because I still work in the family business, my writing schedule works around the day job somewhat. I write for a couple hours in the morning, work, drive kids to school or sports, ride my horse in the late afternoon, and then write for a couple more hours at night. I try and get 4 hours in a day with my writing. I write quickly, so a typical day yields me 10-15 pages.</p>
<p>Darrell - How did you come up with the idea of basing a mystery series around wine?</p>
<p>Michele - I was doing some side work for a wine distributor to supplement my income a bit. I was up in the wine country on a trip and I just kept thinking about how fun it would be to write something set in Napa Valley that had mystery tied to it. I could see a grown up kind of Nancy Drew on the vineyard. I wrote it and it worked very well. There are now 6 books in that series.</p>
<p>Darrell - What made you branch out into writing thriller books?</p>
<p>Michele - I actually started with thrillers. However, the thriller market is a tough one to tap. E-publishing has changed that for me. My book “Mommy, May I?” spent some time making the rounds with the editorial staff at Harpers a few years ago with them suggesting a man’s name for the author.</p>
<p>Eventually they made a pass on the book, but in the long run that has been a good thing for me. That book has been in the top 10 in Paid Kindle sales for a month in The U.K. as well as my other thriller “Daddy’s Home.”</p>
<p>The interesting thing about that book is that when I received it back from Harpers with the letter saying that they had decided to pass on it, I was pretty upset because I had been submitting books for years and had received a lot of rejections. My middle kid who was 9 at the time saw that I was upset about it and he said to me, “Don’t you know, Mom, that God wouldn’t have made you a writer if He didn’t think you couldn’t do it.” He was right. I enjoy writing the thrillers and will continue doing so under the A.K. Alexander pen name. I am actually working on one right now set in the wine country, and the next thriller out will be available in August. The title of that book is “Covert Reich.”</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best type of marketing a writer can do to promote themselves?</p>
<p>Michele - I have done a lot of things–contests, social media, I blog, have a website, newsletter, book trailers, contests, free chapters, radio shows, e-mails to reviewers, virtual blog tours, conferences, etc. I make a point of trying to at least do one thing a day that gets the word out that there are books available. Word of mouth is the key still, and as writers we are fortunate to live in the Internet age where word of mouth can happen ten-fold.</p>
<p>Darrell - How do you see the future for writers and publishers now that ebooks have arrived on the scene?</p>
<p>Michele - It is a great time to be a writer. Print won’t ever die so publishers will still be in business, and I think they will continue to support and back their big guns. However, as a mid-list author I am very happy to see this day. I am earning a living doing what I love. Readers are reading my books and enjoying them. No longer does the mid-list author have to be a part of the big corporate wheel of supporting the bestsellers and the publisher. We can now compete on an even level with them. I think as with anything, the cream will rise to the top. Anyone can put out a book now, but selling those books is another thing. I also think there is a little magic involved. Publishers will stay in business but writers will have an upperhand and be able to control and manage their business the way they see fit.</p>

<p>Darrell Pitt &#8211; What Does it Take to be a Successful Author?</p>
<p>Darrell Pitt is a writer of young adult novels. He is the author of The Steampunk Detective, The Last Days of Earth, Diary of a Teenage Superhero and is now the editor of Secrets of Successful Writers.</p>
<p>Today he talks about how he became a writer and what he believes are the best ways a writer can succeed in this ever changing environment.</p>
<p>Darrell - Does it feel strange interviewing yourself?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; Yes, but I often talk to myself and I&#8217;ve never had an argument yet!</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; So, how did you become a writer?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; I can trace it back to when I was twelve years old. We had to write a story a week as part of our class work. I had only ever written stories of half a page in length. On this occasion I was inspired to write an adventure story along the lines of Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
<p>As our work was handed back to the class, the teacher stopped, held up my story and announced, &#8220;It has finally happened. Darrell has written a story three and a half pages long&#8221;. She then proceeded to read it aloud to the class.</p>
<p>That was one of the happiest moments of my childhood. Now when I look back on it, I realise that positive reinforcement was probably the stimulus for my desire to become a writer.</p>
<p>At high school I received support from another teacher. I also won a writing competition, published short stories and submitted many articles to our local newspaper. My initial goal was to become a journalist, but, things did not work out that way.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; So instead you worked diligently day and night to become a successful author?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; I wish I had. Life has a way of throwing curve balls at you. I got into a relationship, became a father, got out of a relationship, got married, studied some more, helped to raise a wonderful daughter and veered wildly in all sorts of directions.</p>
<p>During these many years I was still writing, but not as much as I should have done. I wrote short stories and had many of them published in small press magazines. I also wrote a novel called Kaotika which was rewritten about nine times and still remains an unpublishable train wreck.</p>
<p>But you know, every step in a wrong direction is still a step forward.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; What was the turning point?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; My wife and I owned cafes for a number of years. Hospitality is hard work. Just ask anyone employed in it. The hours were long, the stress was through the roof and there were times when I thought I might just have a heart attack and die.</p>
<p>After we sold our business I began to look to the far horizon to work out what to do next. By this point my daughter had left school and for the first time in many years I realised I could focus on my life long dream of becoming a writer.</p>
<p>I applied to go to university (yes, they accept old people like me) and I got in. At the same time I started producing young adult novels. A number of those have since been published.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; What are the lows and highs you&#8217;ve experienced as a writer?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; There have been plenty of both.</p>
<p>I once paid a manuscript appraisal agency a lot of money to have a novel critiqued. Their response was five pages in length. They commended me in my efforts at wanting to become a writer.</p>
<p>Everything after that was negative. Characters, plot, theme, genre, even the title were criticised. You know those horror films where people get stabbed twenty times and beaten to a pulp before finally expiring? That&#8217;s how I felt.</p>
<p>It took me about two days to rouse myself from my depression. It took me a lot longer to see their assessment in a critical fashion. These days I can make jokes about it. (You know you have healed when you can make a joke about a painful situation.) That book is still sitting in the drawer waiting for a rewrite. It&#8217;s actually not all that bad, but it will be a better novel when it appears because I&#8217;m now a better writer.</p>
<p>As far as highs go, every time I sell a book, it&#8217;s a high.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; Would you recommend that people become writers?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; Only if they&#8217;re happy to work for free. I&#8217;m serious when I say this. I don&#8217;t mean they will always be working for free, but they will be working alone without recognition for many hours and days. They won&#8217;t earn a cent. They will suffer rejection and criticism. There is a lot of pain involved.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that you become a writer because you don&#8217;t really have a choice in the matter. You love creating stories. That&#8217;s why you do it.</p>
<p>Darrell - What do you think is the best way a writer can market themselves in this era of ebook publishing?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; I think Facebook and Twitter and all the social media methods mentioned by all the other writers in this book are part of the equation.</p>
<p>I think one issue that doesn&#8217;t get mentioned enough is that you need to have a number of books out there. One book isn&#8217;t enough. Unless you&#8217;ve written the next &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221;, you need another book ready for your reader to purchase. As soon as you finish writing one book you need to start on the next. And the next.</p>
<p>Let me say this again. I think you need about three or four books out there before you really focus on marketing your work.</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; Any last words?</p>
<p>Darrell &#8211; Just a couple. Support the authors. Buy their books. They gave their time freely to be interviewed and to share their secrets of their writing success with you. Buy their books and send them an email to congratulate them on their hard work.</p>
