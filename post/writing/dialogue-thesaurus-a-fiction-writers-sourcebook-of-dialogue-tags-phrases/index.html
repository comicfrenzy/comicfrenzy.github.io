<p>In the world of romance writing, one of the most important components in an author’s repertoire is their use of descriptive words and phrases. This aspect of romance writing is so often neglected, usually with disastrous results; a novel that reads like a badly written script.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s now a way for any writer, regardless of their experience, to get a huge head-start writing in this profitable genre. It’s a secret resource that romance writers don’t want you to know about!</p>
<p>Dahlia Evans has compiled a romance writing thesaurus unlike anything ever published. This reference book is filled to the brim with words and phrases gathered from hundreds of bestselling romance novels. Using this book you will be able to describe intimate encounters of every kind without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>Inside You’ll Discover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>8,500 words and phrases sorted into 37 categories.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thousands of words you can use to describe each part of the body.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Words that describe each of the five senses; taste, touch, sight, sound, smell.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Words to describe feelings and emotions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Words that describe facial expressions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hundreds of words to describe intimacy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thinking Like A Romance Writer</em> is the culmination of hundreds of hours of research and is a book destined to become a classic in the field of romance writing instruction.</p>
<h1 id="Introduction-1"><a href="#Introduction-1" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>The idea for this book came about while I was analyzing the structure of various novels. As part of the exercise, I decided to see if I could somehow catalogue the words and phrases that surround fictional dialogue. It wasn’t long before I discovered a number of patterns. This was a eureka moment in my writing career.</p>
<p>I then asked myself a question: “should I keep this information to myself? Or instead, share it with the writing community.” Knowing how much this information would help budding and professional writers alike, I decided to share it by writing this book.</p>
<p>For me, this thesaurus is a book I didn’t realize I needed. But now that I have it sitting in front of me, I can’t imagine writing fictional dialogue without it. I no longer need to rack my brain to come up with fitting dialogue tags and phrases. Now, I just open this book and away I go! I hope you will have a similar experience.</p>
<h3 id="How-This-Book-Is-Organized"><a href="#How-This-Book-Is-Organized" class="headerlink" title="How This Book Is Organized"></a>How This Book Is Organized</h3><p>The book is broken up into four parts. They are: <em>dialogue and action tags; dialogue adverbs; feelings, emotions, and internal dialogue; body language and movement.</em></p>
<p>In the first three parts all words are sorted in alphabetical order, as well as grouped by category. These categories include: <em>emotion; dynamics; sound; physical state; manner.</em></p>
<p><em>Part Three</em> also includes the following two categories: <em>modifying words; internal dialogue and thought tags.</em></p>
<p>Entries for parts <em>One</em> to <em>Three</em> are separated by a semicolon.</p>
<p><em>Part Four</em> is structured slightly differently. Entries are sorted by <em>physical feature</em>; with each entry separated by a line break.</p>
<p>Example sentences <em>(‘USAGE EXAMPLES’)</em> are used at the end of each category to give the reader an idea of how to use an entry in a dialogue sequence. Each entry is italicized.</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Use-This-Book"><a href="#How-To-Use-This-Book" class="headerlink" title="How To Use This Book"></a>How To Use This Book</h3><p><strong><em>1) I’m sick of using ‘he said’ and ‘she said’ so often. I want some variety!</em></strong></p>
<p>In this case, go to <em>PART 1 &#8211; Dialogue and Action Tags</em> and select a tag; either by alphabet, or by category. If you know what type of emotion you wish to express &#8211; and that emotion is included &#8211; select a word that fits your dialogue.</p>
<p><strong><em>2) I want to use an adverb to add a little spice.</em></strong></p>
<p>Adverbs, if used sparingly, can add a spark to your dialogue writing. No matter what any critic says, adverbs will always have a place in fiction. Just remember: quality over quantity. <em>PART 2 &#8211; Dialogue Adverbs</em> includes pretty much every usable adverb that can be combined with <em>‘said’</em> (or other dialogue tags).</p>
<p><strong><em>3) My dialogue is ambiguous, so I want to explain what the character is feeling.</em></strong></p>
<p>In this case, go to <em>PART 3 &#8211; Feelings, Emotions, and Internal Dialogue</em>. Here you will find every major feeling and emotion word out there. Using the <em>Modifying Words</em> category will give you some ideas when structuring your sentences.</p>
<p>If you want to write internal dialogue then go to the category: <em>Internal Dialogue and Thought Tags</em> for a great selection of tags.</p>
<p><strong><em>4) I want to show the character’s actions to help the reader visualize the scene.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>PART 4 &#8211; Body Language and Movement</em> gives you everything you need to describe a character’s body language and movement. These phrases will bring your dialogue to life!</p>
<p>While you can use these phrases as they are, it is my hope that you will also use them as inspiration to come up with your own variations. Combine, rearrange, and alter ‘til your heart’s content.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your investment. I hope this thesaurus aids you in all your future writing projects.</p>
<p>Warm Wishes,</p>
<p>Dahlia Evans</p>
