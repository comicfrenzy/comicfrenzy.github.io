<h1 id="FOREWORD"><a href="#FOREWORD" class="headerlink" title="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h1><p>One of the saddest lessons you will learn when you go to art school is that your art is not very good. One day in sophomore year you will look down at your Dali-inspired colored pencil drawing of anthropomorphic lizards, and you won&#8217;t be able to ignore it any longer. You&#8217;ll look up at your professor and see it in her eyes: she thinks you&#8217;re a bad artist. She thinks you&#8217;re a bad artist, and she doesn&#8217;t think you&#8217;re ever going to get better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very creative,&#8221; she&#8217;ll say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; you&#8217;ll say.</p>
<p>John Lowe thinks you can get better. In fact, he&#8217;s sure you can get better. He&#8217;s sure you can get good.</p>
<p>This is what makes John Lowe a great teacher and an unusual one. If you are his student, he is interested in you and he is interested in your art. He finds out what your goals are, and he doesn&#8217;t let you forget them. He finds out what your comfort zone is, and he jabs and teases you out of it. He finds out what tools you&#8217;re used to using, and he doesn&#8217;t let you use them anymore. He finds out how much homework you&#8217;re used to doing, and he assigns twice as much. He takes artwork you were up all night working on and tells you to change everything. He tells you to change everything, and you squawk in disbelief, and John laughs and say, &#8220;Nothing&#8217;s precious.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s true: nothing you put on paper is precious. You have something else that&#8217;s precious, and it&#8217;s something John will find for you when you can&#8217;t find it yourself anymore. It&#8217;s why you started drawing in the first place. It&#8217;s in your hand, your eyes, your heart. Don&#8217;t lose it. Don&#8217;t let it get away.</p>

<h1 id="PREFACE"><a href="#PREFACE" class="headerlink" title="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h1><p>I decided to become a comic book artist when I was in the seventh grade. I told everyone I knew about my career decision, whether they asked or not. I wasn&#8217;t bragging&#8212;I knew that making my intent public would make me less likely to back out of it.</p>
<p>I earned a degree in fine art from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I had several exceptional professors who taught me how to draw from observation. If comics only required the ability to draw from life, I would have felt comfortable with the portfolio that I took to the offices of Marvel and DC comics the year after I graduated.</p>
<p>However, comic art requires additional skills, many of them. A comic book artist is required to demonstrate an understanding of perspective, composition, page and panel design, acting, and staging. A comic book artist must be able to create things that don&#8217;t exist, which means he or she has to have the ability to make constructive (instead of observational) drawings. My college training didn&#8217;t prepare me for that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my drawing skills helped me land a position as an inking assistant for one of my favorite inkers Josef (Joe) Rubenstein. I didn&#8217;t do much more than fill in large areas of black ink, and cut Zip-a-tone patterns out, but I got to see an amazing inker working on real comic pages every day. Joe was also kind enough to critique the inking sample pages I was working on at night. I was inking for DC Comics within a year.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990s I worked with some of the most talented comic artists in the industry, and over the course of that decade they helped me develop my drawing and storytelling skills.</p>
<p>I began working as a sequential art professor at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in 2002. SCAD became my home, and teaching became my passion. Creating classes and lectures, and mapping out syllabi and lesson plans, forced me to structure my thoughts. I love teaching. It&#8217;s the most exciting and rewarding job I&#8217;ve ever had. I always look forward to entering the classroom and seeing the work my students produce.</p>
<p>When I began writing, I imagined the book my students (and my younger self) would want to discover at the library. When choosing what to cover, I considered what I believe to be essential rules for drawing. If it wasn&#8217;t essential, I removed it.</p>
<p>Learning to draw requires you to learn to see differently. And each of us sees things in a unique way. The chapters in this book are arranged sequentially and should be followed in order. The first chapters deal with learning how to see and interpret the world around you (observational techniques), and how to create things from your imagination (constructive techniques).</p>
<p>The latter chapters are devoted exclusively to producing comic book pages. You will learn how to use tools, techniques, and software to create comic pages quickly. Speed is important. Comic artists, on average, need to produce at least one finished comic page per day.</p>
<p>The most rewarding part of teaching is watching young artists develop their artistic voices. That&#8217;s another reason I avoided writing a book that centered on specific techniques. All too often, students who rely on learning how to create artwork based on a very rigid technical approach developed by another artist, produce homogenous pieces of art. I like idiosyncrasies. This book contains tried and true principles that will allow you to develop an artistic style that belongs to you.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing what you produce.</p>

<h2 id="The-Two-D-8217-s-Desire-and-Discipline"><a href="#The-Two-D-8217-s-Desire-and-Discipline" class="headerlink" title="The Two D&#8217;s: Desire and Discipline"></a>The Two D&#8217;s: Desire and Discipline</h2><p>Desire is the easy part. Almost everyone wants to excel at something: sports, music, writing, acting, dancing, or creating art. And the fact of the matter is that all people can succeed if they dedicate themselves to intelligent study and consistent practice. That is what separates those who will eventually succeed in their chosen field from the dilettantes.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t realize how many skills a successful sequential artist has to master. A thorough knowledge of anatomy and figure drawing, composition, design (both within a panel and in arranging several panels on a page), storytelling, shot selection, and perspective is essential.</p>
<p>As a comic artist, if you work with a writer, you are required to draw anything that he or she can imagine: a crowded New York City street, a coliseum filled with spectators and participants, Berlin during World War II, and so on. If something doesn&#8217;t exist, such as a planet no one has seen before, you must create that world, its buildings and vehicles, and its inhabitants. I realize this sounds intimidating, but when you have honed your talent, it&#8217;s an exciting and enjoyable challenge.</p>
<p>Every artist has the same hurdles to overcome. We have all struggled with feelings of ineptitude and frustration. Thoughts such as &#8220;My human figures never look right,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll never learn perspective,&#8221; &#8220;This is just too hard,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m not fast enough,&#8221; &#8220;They are better than me,&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a chance&#8221; have all gone through everyone&#8217;s head at one point or another. I&#8217;ve certainly had all of those thoughts. However, dedication and daily practice will quell those fears.</p>
<p>I have taught sequential art for over a decade and have had the pleasure of seeing former students go on to successful careers, win awards, create their own comic characters, and have their creations optioned for film and television. Teaching confirmed a suspicion I&#8217;ve always held: talent is overrated. Sure, some students came in and displayed such artistic facility that I knew from the time they turned in their first assignments that they would be working professionally in a short time. But those were the (very) rare exceptions. The majority of students I teach begin at the same skill level. They like drawing and have filled up sketchbooks with their favorite characters, but they don&#8217;t know how to draw two or more characters interacting, how to place those characters in an environment by using perspective, how to portray subtle emotions, or how to pace a story. That&#8217;s why they came to college to study comics.</p>
<p>The determining factor in a student&#8217;s success is his or her willingness to work consistently and intelligently. Successful students listen to constructive criticism, study books to improve their storytelling and drawing skills, gain the ability to analyze their work objectively, and, perhaps most important, draw daily.</p>
<p>If you are considering a career in comics, the most important question to ask yourself is &#8220;Do I love drawing and telling stories?&#8221; Every comic artist I know works at his or her drafting table for at least eight hours a day. Most of them put in more hours than that. They do it because they love it and wouldn&#8217;t consider doing anything else.</p>
<h2 id="Necessary-Materials"><a href="#Necessary-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Necessary Materials"></a>Necessary Materials</h2><p>Learning to draw well requires you to invest time, not money. I love that. If you own a pencil and some printer paper, you&#8217;re good to go. However, there are some standard drawing tools that most comic artists use daily.</p>
<h3 id="PENCILS"><a href="#PENCILS" class="headerlink" title="PENCILS"></a>PENCILS</h3><p>There is a wide assortment of graphite drawing pencils available. These pencils are typically sold in a range from 6H to 8B. The H series denotes a hard lead; the pencil lead becomes firmer and produces a lighter line as the numbers increase. Conversely, the B series signifies a softer lead and produces a darker line as the numbers increase.</p>
<p>Since comic art is primarily linear, it isn&#8217;t necessary to purchase a full range of pencils. A standard #2 pencil uses an HB lead that is great for preliminary drawings or sketching, but has a tendency to smudge if you run your hand over the drawing. Many artists prefer to sketch or do their layouts with an HB (most school pencils are HB) or 2B pencil and use a 2H pencil for their final drawings.</p>
<p>The shading for the drawing below was done twice: once with an HB pencil (this page) and once with a 2H pencil (this page).</p>
<h3 id="ERASERS"><a href="#ERASERS" class="headerlink" title="ERASERS"></a>ERASERS</h3><p>A kneaded eraser is the best option when you draw. It is pliable, it doesn&#8217;t leave any residue on the page, and it will not adversely affect the surface of any paper. If you need to erase a large area, such as the entire page after you have inked it and want to remove the remaining pencil lines, use a large white rubber eraser.</p>
<h3 id="PAPER"><a href="#PAPER" class="headerlink" title="PAPER"></a>PAPER</h3><p>You should not invest in high-quality paper until you start producing finished pages. Buy a ream (500 sheets) of printer paper and an inexpensive sketchbook. I prefer a 9-inch by 12-inch spiral-bound sketchbook because you don&#8217;t have to hold it open like a book, which can be irritating when sketching.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ah16u3rj21ab0mjwhq.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ah16u3rj21ab0mjwhq.jpg" alt=""> An HB pencil (most standard #2 school pencils are HB) is a great sketching tool, but the lead is soft and it often smudges.</p>

You can buy mechanical pencils (no sharpening required) that hold a 0.3-, 0.5-, 0.7-, or 0.9-mm-diameter piece of lead. You can purchase pencil sets if you want a range of leads from firm to soft. But really, all you need is an everyday school pencil and a handheld pencil sharpener.</p>

You can purchase white rubber erasers in large and small sizes. The large size is great for erasing pages of 11-inch by 17-inch original art. The Helix eraser pictured here houses a pencil sharpener; that&#8217;s pretty nifty.</p>

<p>DRAWING OBJECTS FROM MEMORY</p>
<p>This is one of the best exercises for any aspiring comic artist. It isn&#8217;t complicated, and thanks to the Internet, you have an unlimited resource for interesting things to draw.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need a blue pencil, a ballpoint pen, and a timer of some sort for this exercise.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a photograph of an interesting object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look at it for one minute and try to commit as much information to memory as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Turn away from the computer or minimize the window the object is displayed in and try to draw the object in blue pencil in two minutes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look at the object again and spend the next two minutes making an observational drawing in ballpoint pen on top of the pencil drawing. If you made mistakes in your initial sketch (and you will), correct them with the pen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This exercise will improve your visual memory and make you observe the world around you more closely. Learning to draw well requires careful observation and analysis.</p>

<h2 id="Drawing-Straight-Lines"><a href="#Drawing-Straight-Lines" class="headerlink" title="Drawing Straight Lines"></a>Drawing Straight Lines</h2><p>The old adage &#8220;I can&#8217;t even draw a straight line&#8221; is erroneous. Anyone can do this with practice, and learning to draw straight lines without the aid of a ruler is worth the investment in practice time. It will make your drawings look more confident, save you a lot of time, and allow you to draw freehand perspective grids (I&#8217;ll elaborate on this in chapter 3). Drawing long straight lines requires you to draw by using your arm, and to do that you must hold the pencil differently.</p>
<p>FREEHAND DRAWING</p>
<p>Make sure to clear everything off the drawing surface before you begin.</p>
<p>Place your elbow on the table and hold the pencil in an upright position, rotating your hand so that your palm is resting on the paper; this positioning prevents you from using your fingers or wrist, which will cause your line to curve, when you draw. Now, using your elbow as a fulcrum, draw a line across the paper.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aj3l0xuj20ss0nr0v7.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aj3l0xuj20ss0nr0v7.jpg" alt=""> Everyone has a natural stroke. When I draw freehand straight lines, my arm moves from left to right at a 45-degree angle. Some of my students find that their natural stroke moves from top to bottom or vice versa. Find your natural stroke; you can always move the paper around to accommodate it.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aj83ue4j20ss0obmyx.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aj83ue4j20ss0obmyx.jpg" alt=""> After you get comfortable drawing straight lines, draw a series of equidistant parallel, straight lines. Draw at least ten lines per group.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajgdmthj20rs0h4aaj.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajgdmthj20rs0h4aaj.jpg" alt=""> You should also practice drawing straight lines that connect two points. Keep doing this, varying the distance between the points (some can be short distances, but others should be much longer), until you can draw straight lines through them at will.</p>
<h2 id="Seeing-Forms"><a href="#Seeing-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Seeing Forms"></a>Seeing Forms</h2><p>Artists must train themselves to see the simple forms of any object first and to recognize that anything they see can be placed within cubes, spheres, cylinders, or cones.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajm4ezkj21000zvq5p.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajm4ezkj21000zvq5p.jpg" alt=""> Train yourself to see the underlying form(s) of any object. The underlying forms of all these objects have been highlighted. Identifying the basic shape or combination of shapes in the object you are sketching is a fundamental principle of good drawing.</p>
<p>Complicated objects are composed of various combinations of these basic shapes. Before you draw anything from observation, study your subject and ask yourself, &#8220;What is the underlying shape, or shapes, of the thing I&#8217;m drawing?&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajrvenbj212d145776.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajrvenbj212d145776.jpg" alt=""> This freehand box construction helped the artist locate the placement of the building&#8217;s features and see a complicated object as a simple form.</p>

The majority of the bottle is found within a box. The stem and cap are located within a cylinder, which houses two sets of ellipses (circles drawn in perspective).</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ak9do63j21je0o10vm.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ak9do63j21je0o10vm.jpg" alt=""> This box helped the artist visualize how much space the skull&#8217;s shape takes up. The drawing begins with the placement of general shapes. By adding details and altering the lines of the basic shapes the artist makes this an interesting drawing.</p>
<h2 id="Contour-Drawings"><a href="#Contour-Drawings" class="headerlink" title="Contour Drawings"></a>Contour Drawings</h2><p>Contour lines, especially in comic book art, play a crucial role in the way the viewer perceives the surface of a figure or object. They map out the surface of an object that would otherwise look flat and create volume within a linear drawing.</p>
<p>Look at some shapes. It&#8217;s hard to see them as anything other than flat patterns, as if someone had outlined a silhouette. But you can create several unique interpretations of those basic shapes by drawing different directional lines across them, manipulating their surfaces.</p>
<p>Contour drawing also makes an artist aware of the way subtle shifts in lines can create significant shifts in the way an object is perceived. When you are practicing contour drawings, see if you can &#8220;feel&#8221; the object you are drawing&#8212;imagine the sensation of running your pencil along the surface of the object. Then draw through it to the other side.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easiest to explain this with a simple example. A football has two stripes that wrap around it. When you make a contour drawing, you want to feel your way around those stripes. Don&#8217;t just draw a line on the surface; draw an ellipse all the way through the football as if you can see through the material to the other side. It takes a little practice, but when you start perceiving things this way, your drawings will improve quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8akeouufj21c10w3juc.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8akeouufj21c10w3juc.jpg" alt=""> Each of these complex shapes began as a simple freehand ellipse drawing. The direction in which the lines are drawn modifies the way the surface is perceived. Contour lines transform shapes into forms.</p>

<p>DEFINING VOLUME THROUGH LINE</p>
<p>Draw some generic shapes and then draw contour lines within those shapes.</p>
<p>Modify one shape several times by using only contour lines. Trace over photographs with contour lines. This will help you gain a better understanding of the planes and surfaces of any figures, faces, or objects you draw.</p>
<p>Study the following example. The basic shapes were identified first and drawn in blue pencil. This approach allows you to concentrate initially on basic shape relationships to help you see proportions correctly. Contour lines were added next to give volume and detail to the drawing. Then a ballpoint pen was used to identify the contours of the subject.</p>

The exterior line is thicker than the interior lines; this helps the viewer read the interior lines as details within the bottle.</p>
<h2 id="Drawing-Multiple-Objects"><a href="#Drawing-Multiple-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Drawing Multiple Objects"></a>Drawing Multiple Objects</h2><p>When you have become adept at seeing and drawing the underlying forms of any subject you choose to draw, and at adding specific details on top of those shapes, you&#8217;re ready to practice drawing multiple objects. A still life will train you to draw a group of objects and make them proportionaly to one another. Here are two techniques to help you make a good observational drawing:</p>
<p>&#8226; Plumb lines. Plumb lines are a series of straight vertical or horizontal lines that are used to help you determine where objects align with one another. Hold your pencil or another straight object such as a skewer at arm&#8217;s length to establish the size relationships and angles of the objects you are drawing. You can also apply this technique to photographs.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8alo812sj20c00ckwh2.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8alo812sj20c00ckwh2.jpg" alt=""> Creating a still life is easy to do: just gather a few things from around the house.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8alszcsmj20bz0cegoc.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8alszcsmj20bz0cegoc.jpg" alt=""> PLUMB LINES<br>The blue lines are the horizontal plumb lines. The red lines are vertical plumb lines. I&#8217;ve used the tissue box as a point of reference. Its left edge aligns with the middle of the glass and with the end of the banana. Its right edge touches the stem of the banana and reveals a small negative space between the stem and the banana&#8217;s body. The drapery edge hits the tissue box on its left-hand side.</p>
<p>&#8226; Quadrants. When working from a photograph like in the example below, draw a rectangle around the subjects you want to draw and draw a vertical line and a horizontal line through the rectangle&#8217;s midpoints. The four quadrants this creates help you place the objects more accurately within your drawing. If you are working from life, make a viewfinder by cutting a rectangle out of a sheet of printer paper discarding this rectangle and putting marks on the vertical and horizontal midpoints of this frame. If you feel very ambitious, tape strings to the midpoint marks, creating four quadrants within the viewfinder.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am54ku0j20c20ck0vl.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am54ku0j20c20ck0vl.jpg" alt=""> QUADRANTS<br>If you were drawing the objects pictured here, ask yourself these questions about the placement of the objects in the quadrants: How high is the box in relation to the banana? Where does the drapery intersect the box? What is angle of the banana?</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am9n4iuj20c10grmze.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am9n4iuj20c10grmze.jpg" alt=""> This is the final pencil sketch. You can see that it has employed plumb lines and quadrants and utilized contour lines to better represent the shape of the banana.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8amh93irj20p80hnwhj.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8amh93irj20p80hnwhj.jpg" alt=""> This complex interior space began as a series of boxes.</p>

Everything shown in this illustration (the bicycle, the various building shapes and facades, the van, etc.) seems correct, even though they are drawn in a style that would be a categorized more as &#8220;cartoony&#8221; than &#8220;realistic.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Divide-a-Square"><a href="#How-to-Divide-a-Square" class="headerlink" title="How to Divide a Square"></a>How to Divide a Square</h2><p>It sounds silly, but the square is the most valuable and necessary shape for any type of technical drawing (environments, props, vehicles, etc.). If you can train yourself to draw one perfect square, you can place and multiply additional perfect squares infinitely. This is an invaluable tool for perspective drawing.</p>
<ol>
<li>A square is composed of four equidistant sides, and you can locate its vertical and horizontal midpoints by drawing an X through it and then drawing a horizontal and vertical line through the center of this X.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8amyhjsbj208o0rutal.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8amyhjsbj208o0rutal.jpg" alt="">   2. You can also locate smaller squares inside it by placing a single point on the X and drawing a horizontal and vertical line from this point, parallel to the original sides of the square. Complete the square. Each time one of the new lines connects with the X&#8217;s line, change direction, until you end back at your initial point.</p>

<li>Once you have one perfect square, you can create other squares around it. To add a square on the right, for example, extend the top and bottom lines of the initial square and draw a line from the top left corner through the vertical midpoint on the right side of the square, until it intersects with the newly extended line.</li>

Almost every manmade structure incorporates symmetrical design.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the two squares in this illustration. I&#8217;ve placed a simple curve in the left-hand square. I know the curve begins at the bottom left corner of the square on the left, and so a symmetrical curve will end at the bottom right corner of the square on the right. Locating one additional point on the curve will help me mirror this curve.</li>

Every inorganic object you observe or want to invent can be constructed with cubes: buildings, cars, chairs, city blocks, and so on. This may sound like an overstatement. It is not.</p>

The cubes I have used to illustrate these principles were designed in Adobe Illustrator for clarity, but I don&#8217;t use computer programs to make any of my initial drawings.</p>
<p>As you work through these lessons, draw the cubes with a pencil, or a series of colored pencils (varying line color can help prevent confusion), and freehand straight lines. Here you will use a principle called orthographic projection to create these cubes; this sounds much more complicated and technical than it really is. Orthographic drawings use a series of parallel lines to give the illusion of depth.</p>
<p>Read and draw along with each of the following examples. Make several of these drawings until they become second nature.</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw a freehand cube.</li>
</ol>

Extend lines from the inside corners so that you can &#8220;see&#8221; the back of the cube. Imagine that you are drawing a cube made of clear plastic.</p>

Now draw a line down the back and connect the two bottom lines with a line running across the bottom of the cube. I call this running around the cube.</p>

<h2 id="Perspective-Drawing"><a href="#Perspective-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="Perspective Drawing"></a>Perspective Drawing</h2><p>Almost all drawings use perspective. The only ones that don&#8217;t are easily recognizable&#8212;they&#8217;re flat illustrations, such as logos or hieroglyphs. Perspective gives drawings an element of depth. A comic artist must have the ability to draw people and environments from any vantage point quickly and accurately. Therefore, proficiency in perspective drawing is a required skill.</p>
<p>When it is taught properly, perspective drawing isn&#8217;t very hard. The key is to take your time and fully master each technique before moving on to the next. At times you will probably become confused. When that happens, read the lesson again and keep making drawings until you understand the principle fully.</p>

Think of the horizon line as a camera&#8217;s lens; you also may want to think of it as eye level. In this drawing, the lens&#8217;s eye level is just below the woman&#8217;s ear.</p>
<h3 id="COMMON-ELEMENTS-IN-PERSPECTIVE-DRAWINGS"><a href="#COMMON-ELEMENTS-IN-PERSPECTIVE-DRAWINGS" class="headerlink" title="COMMON ELEMENTS IN PERSPECTIVE DRAWINGS"></a>COMMON ELEMENTS IN PERSPECTIVE DRAWINGS</h3><p>&#8226; Horizon Line: The horizon line in a drawing represents the viewer&#8217;s eye level. The easiest way to understand this concept is to think about using a camera. You look through a viewfinder or at a screen display to frame a picture. Although you can move the camera up and down, your eye level&#8212;the distance between your eyes and the ground&#8212;remains the same.</p>
<p>&#8226; The Standard Horizon Line: Most family photographs are taken by someone standing directly in front of his or her subjects. This means the horizon line (eye level) of those photographs falls somewhere between 5 feet 6 inches and 6 feet.</p>
<p>&#8226; The High Horizon Line: If you take a picture from the balcony of a very tall building, your eye level is hundreds of feet in the air. In comics, this eye level is referred to as a down shot or a bird&#8217;s-eye view. These angles often are used in comics to establish a scene&#8217;s setting.</p>
<p>&#8226; The Low Horizon Line: If you lie on your stomach and take a picture of a toddler, he or she will appear huge because your eye level is just a few inches from the ground. In comics, this eye level is referred to as an up shot or a worm&#8217;s-eye view. In storytelling, a low horizon line is usually used when you want to make a person or object look imposing and powerful.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re drawing, every panel on every page should have a horizon line, even if there aren&#8217;t any backgrounds in the panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aczt4fkj20w30i8dgz.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aczt4fkj20w30i8dgz.jpg" alt=""> When any object begins to turn away from you, its sides begin to recede, diminish, and converge toward vanishing points.</p>

Vanishing points are marked by dots on the horizon line.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ai8l9c7j21210uhjua.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ai8l9c7j21210uhjua.jpg" alt=""> Different objects can have different vanishing points, but with a few exceptions I&#8217;ll cover later, those vanishing points must be located on the same horizon line. Think of the horizon line as representing your eye level. The easiest way to understand that is to think about taking a picture. The horizon line is your eye level as you look through your viewfinder. In most snapshots, the eye level is somewhere between five to six feet&#8212;the height of the person taking the picture. However, if the same person took a picture from the balcony of a fifth-floor apartment, the eye level, or horizon lines, would also be located five floors above.</p>

<h3 id="ONE-POINT-PERSPECTIVE"><a href="#ONE-POINT-PERSPECTIVE" class="headerlink" title="ONE-POINT PERSPECTIVE"></a>ONE-POINT PERSPECTIVE</h3><p>A one-point perspective drawing is made up of vertical, horizontal, and perspective lines. All the vertical lines in the drawing are parallel to one another, all the horizontal lines are parallel to one another, and all the lines that recede converge toward a single vanishing point.</p>
<p>One-point perspective drawings are a useful learning tool (the single vanishing point prevents confusion), but they aren&#8217;t very practical unless you are drawing a single item from one side. As soon as an object turns, you see two sides of it, and when that happens, you need two vanishing points.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8amep46bj20jy0nfq5x.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8amep46bj20jy0nfq5x.jpg" alt=""> One-point perspective drawing often is used in comics to direct the viewer&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3 id="TWO-POINT-PERSPECTIVE"><a href="#TWO-POINT-PERSPECTIVE" class="headerlink" title="TWO-POINT PERSPECTIVE"></a>TWO-POINT PERSPECTIVE</h3><p>A two-point perspective drawing is made up of perspective lines that recede to one of two vanishing points and vertical lines that are parallel to one another. However, although any given object uses two established vanishing points, remember that other objects in the drawing, when moved, may need new vanishing points. Any time you see two sides of an object, perspective drawing is required. The nearer part of the object is closer to you, and therefore bigger. Lines begin to converge as the object recedes into space. Look at the illustration below.</p>
<p>Almost every object you draw in two-point perspective has vanishing points on one horizon line. The only exception to this is an object that is tilted up or down. For example, if you are drawing a table covered in books and one of the books is resting on another book, its lines will converge and recede toward a new horizon line.</p>
<p>Two-point perspective is the most commonly used drawing technique in comics, and once you understand it, three-point perspective is a snap.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8apge3cgj20qc0jzwhn.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8apge3cgj20qc0jzwhn.jpg" alt=""> All the lines within any single object converge to one of two vanishing points located on the horizon line.</p>
<h3 id="THREE-POINT-PERSPECTIVE"><a href="#THREE-POINT-PERSPECTIVE" class="headerlink" title="THREE-POINT PERSPECTIVE"></a>THREE-POINT PERSPECTIVE</h3><p>In three-point perspective drawings, all the lines converge to points. The third point serves as a nexus for all the vertical lines in the panel, and it can be placed above or below the horizon line. The third point needs to be placed far from the horizon line. If it isn&#8217;t, the converging lines will make the drawing look distorted.</p>

<h2 id="Placing-Objects"><a href="#Placing-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Placing Objects"></a>Placing Objects</h2><p>Have you ever drawn several people in a room, only to realize they don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re all standing on the same floor? Have you ever been confused when you try to place objects in an interior space? How do you know that the objects you&#8217;ve placed in your drawing are spaced correctly on the ground and are in perspective?</p>
<h3 id="HOW-TO-REMEMBER-ESSENTIAL-INFORMATION-ABOUT-OBJECTS"><a href="#HOW-TO-REMEMBER-ESSENTIAL-INFORMATION-ABOUT-OBJECTS" class="headerlink" title="HOW TO REMEMBER ESSENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OBJECTS"></a>HOW TO REMEMBER ESSENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OBJECTS</h3><p>The questions above should sound familiar. Every artist I know has dealt with them at one time or another. The inability to create believable environments is frustrating, and can limit, if not prevent, a career in comics.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they don&#8217;t have to be so daunting. You just have to simplify how you see things. The only information you need to draw inanimate objects in perspective, and place them correctly, is the object&#8217;s height, width, and depth.</p>
<p>The easiest way to visualize this concept is to imagine a box fitting around whatever you are drawing. If you needed to build a wood-paneled box for your refrigerator, how tall would the wood need to be? How wide would the panel need to be to cover the front and back? How long would the sides be?</p>
<p>Next, look for significant details. My refrigerator has a top and bottom door. The bottom door takes up approximately two-thirds of the refrigerator&#8217;s height. The freezer door takes up the top one-third of the overall space, and there is a small vent under the bottom door. The door handles are on the left-hand side, and they are set in from the edge slightly.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the front and side view of a simplified refrigerator. Since a refrigerator&#8217;s exterior isn&#8217;t complicated, you only need a front and side view to construct it, from any angle.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="GRAPH-PAPER"><a href="#GRAPH-PAPER" class="headerlink" title="GRAPH PAPER"></a>GRAPH PAPER</h3><p>You can, and should, use graph paper to draw a floor plan when need to draw complicated interior and exterior environments. This plan allows you to visualize how the room, or scene, will look from different angles, and prevents you from making mistakes concerning the arrangement of objects.</p>
<p>Graph paper helps you to reduce the objects you intend to draw to basic geometric shapes. Because the paper uses a grid comprised of perfect squares, you can use them as units of measure. The area that a square represents is up to you. Each square could represent a foot, ten feet, or a hundred feet.</p>
<p>For this example, I&#8217;ve decided each square will represent one square foot. I&#8217;ve plotted out a simple bedroom, and used squares and rectangles to note the lengths and widths of every object within it.</p>
<h3 id="THE-PERSPECTIVE-GRID"><a href="#THE-PERSPECTIVE-GRID" class="headerlink" title="THE PERSPECTIVE GRID"></a>THE PERSPECTIVE GRID</h3><p>Now it&#8217;s time to place these in a perspective grid! (For more on using Photoshop to create grids, see &#8220;Creating a Grid in Photoshop&#8221;.)</p>
<p>You can find several perspective grids with a quick Internet search. The most important factor when working with a pre-drawn grid is to make sure that the grid lines create perfect squares in perspective.</p>
<p>Since your graph paper is comprised of squares, all you have to do, initially, is transfer your simple geometric shapes onto your perspective grid. Transferring shapes from graph paper to the grid is as easy as counting squares.</p>
<p>The best part about this method is that there is no guesswork as to where things overlap, and you know that all the objects you draw lie on the same ground plane.</p>
<p>As your skills develop, you may notice that using a pre-drawn grid isn&#8217;t necessary; you can construct your own freehand grids and develop your drawings within those. However, it&#8217;s best to use pre-drawn grids, with perfect squares, until you have mastered perspective drawing.</p>

<h2 id="Gesture-Drawing"><a href="#Gesture-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="Gesture Drawing"></a>Gesture Drawing</h2><p>Creating dynamic figures quickly is fundamental for a comic book artist.</p>
<p>Gesture drawing is quick, easy, and fun. You should never spend more than two or three minutes on a gesture drawing, and it can be done in as little as five seconds.</p>
<p>When making a gesture drawing, you should try to feel the pose and convey that feeling on the page. One of the best ways to do this is to actually take the pose, noting the various twists and turns that occur in your body and the way those positions affect your muscles.</p>
<p>Try this: Bring one leg forward and lean your torso over it. Can you feel the muscles in your thigh contract as the weight of your body shifts to that leg? Or try this one: Clasp your hands together and raise them high over your head in an exaggerated stretch and then lean back. Do you feel your lower back contracting as your abdomen stretches out?</p>
<p>Translate those feelings to lines on the page. Don&#8217;t be afraid to exaggerate in your drawings. Gesture drawing is about communicating an idea, not making a beautiful work of art. Have fun with it. Use any drawing tool you have handy: a pencil, a ballpoint pen, a crayon, a broad piece of charcoal, or a fountain pen.</p>
<p>Try different approaches. Pick up a ballpoint pen and make a drawing without lifting the pen from the paper. Allow it to flow around and through the drawing as you observe your model. Try holding the pencil so that you learn to draw with your entire arm, not just your wrist and fingers.</p>
<p>Gesture drawing is a great way to warm up when you get to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Make it a daily practice. From there, you can then move to more complex figure studies.</p>
<p>If there is a college or art center in your city, check to see if it offers figure drawing sessions you can attend. If it doesn&#8217;t, look for websites that have interesting photos to reference. These two websites were set up for artists looking for figures to draw:</p>
<p>&#8226; <a href="http://www.posemaniacs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.posemaniacs.com</a>. This website has thousands of poses, and you can rotate each pose 360 degrees. The male and female models are skinless computer renderings (so that you can study the underlying musculature of the bodies). This will improve your drawing and help you better understand anatomy visually.</p>
<p>&#8226; <a href="http://www.artists.pixelovely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.artists.pixelovely.com</a>. This website is full of photographs of both clothed and nude models. The home page allows you to choose whether you want to draw clothed, nude, or both and allows you to select the subject&#8217;s gender (or draw both sexes). You also select the amount of time you want each pose to be displayed.</p>

<h2 id="Foreshortening"><a href="#Foreshortening" class="headerlink" title="Foreshortening"></a>Foreshortening</h2><p>Foreshortening occurs when a figure or object is viewed at an unusual angle.</p>

<p>DRAWING FIGURES FROM MEMORY</p>
<p>Memory drawings help you improve your visual memory and vocabulary. When you have a limited amount of time to take in as much information as possible, you train yourself to process the salient information without delay. You learn to identify plumb lines, angles and relationships between the pelvis and the shoulders, and directional angles of limbs, and to locate horizontal and vertical midpoints quickly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to start this practice by using photographs. With a quick Internet image search, it&#8217;s easy to locate very interesting poses that couldn&#8217;t be held by live models. Cameras can capture gymnasts, martial artists, and other athletes in motion.</p>
<p>The process for this exercise is identical to the techniques you used for drawing objects (see this page).</p>
<p>If you perform this exercise often, you&#8217;ll improve your retention of visual information in a short time. It will train you to separate significant details from the superfluous, and you&#8217;ll soon be ready to draw moving figures from life.</p>

Note any visual information that will help you draw the image when the picture&#8217;s no longer in front of you. Is one shoulder higher than the other? How are the elbows, knees, and feet placed? What is the figure&#8217;s vertical midpoint? Its horizontal midpoint?</p>

<h2 id="Drawing-Multiple-Figures"><a href="#Drawing-Multiple-Figures" class="headerlink" title="Drawing Multiple Figures"></a>Drawing Multiple Figures</h2><p>Drawing several figures within the same panel is one of the first major challenges a budding comic artist faces. I&#8217;ll show you a couple approaches that you can take, but one of the best ways to overcome this hurdle is to make a habit of making multiple-figure compositions in your sketchbook. A quick Internet search will provide you with interesting photos taken from a variety of vantage points.</p>
<p>Observational drawing requires you to make a visual analysis of whatever you intend to draw. The subject really doesn&#8217;t matter; it could be a still life, a car, a feral cat, or a group of people. I begin by looking&#8212;really looking&#8212;at my subject. I note plumb lines, angles, quadrants, and midpoints.</p>
<p>My approach to drawing a group of people is very similar to my approach to drawing a foreshortened figure: I begin with the person in the foreground; it&#8217;s the shape that takes up the most space. When I have established that figure, I use it as a reference point to help me place all the other figures in the composition.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a8znmnoj20tr0vqwhl.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a8znmnoj20tr0vqwhl.jpg" alt=""> It&#8217;s best to draw the closest figure first when you&#8217;re drawing a group of people. Then use plumb lines and quadrants to help you place the other figures.</p>

<h2 id="Thumbnail-Drawings"><a href="#Thumbnail-Drawings" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnail Drawings"></a>Thumbnail Drawings</h2><p>Thumbnails are small sketches used to generate visual ideas quickly. They allow you to create multiple versions of specific panels or entire comics pages in a short time.</p>
<p>Generally, comic artists draw two types of thumbnails: rough and tight. Rough thumbnails can be as small as an inch or two in height. This prevents you from overrendering a drawing and also forces you to concentrate on the arrangement of shapes within a panel and the way the shapes within individual panels &#8220;read&#8221; when placed side by side on a page.</p>
<p>You can even use an iPad or any other pressure-sensitive digital tablet to create rough thumbnails.</p>
<p>Most comic pages are drawn on Bristol board, which has blue lines and guides printed on it to help ensure that the panel borders have a consistent width and that the ratio of height to width is correct.</p>
<p>You can also use templates for creating your thumbnails. Templates are just smaller versions of comic pages, and they are easy to make. Simply scan a page that has these guides and reduce its size in Photoshop. Two-, four-, and eight-page templates printed on 8.5-inch by 11-inch printer paper are used the most frequently by comic artists.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aoqya3cj21a90xb0vy.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aoqya3cj21a90xb0vy.jpg" alt=""> If you scan this example into Photoshop, you can create your own templates, fitting two, four, or eight pages on a single sheet of 8.5-inch by 11-inch printer paper.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aav2fgvj20k50uv0vt.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aav2fgvj20k50uv0vt.jpg" alt=""> This artist used a template to create thumbnail layouts for his story. Each page is approximately 2 inches by 4 inches. The small size makes you consider composition and the use of small shapes. At this stage, details are unnecessary.</p>
<p>When you have determined the final compositional layout of a page using rough thumbnails, you may find it helpful to create tight thumbnails. Tight thumbnails are drawn on a larger sheet of paper. Most artists use an 8.5-inch by 11-inch sheet of printer paper with printed guidelines that correspond to an 11-inch by 17-inch Bristol board page. The larger drawing area allows more details to be added and makes drawing horizon lines and vanishing points manageable. These templates also create consistently spaced panel borders, and you can enlarge them in Photoshop to a standard-size art board.</p>
<p>Some artists prefer to draw individual panels on separate pieces of paper. When they have finished all the drawings for a page, they scan them and organize them with a computer program.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajduyg6j20q50z4whp.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajduyg6j20q50z4whp.jpg" alt=""> This artist created her tight thumbnails with a computer. With tight thumbnails, you can include more details, like indications of shadows and text box placements.</p>
<p>COMPOSING THUMBNAILS</p>
<p>Create three to five rough thumbnail compositions for the following scene. Make very small panels, no larger than 1 inch by 2 inches, for each of your drawings.</p>
<p>INTERIOR, PRIVATE DETECTIVE&#8217;S OFFICE - DUSK</p>
<p>A man wielding a gun enters the PI&#8217;s office, threatening to shoot him. The detective is behind his desk, bottle in hand, cigarette in mouth. An older woman holding a small dog is seated across from him. She&#8217;s laughing at the man with the gun.</p>
<p>Ask yourself a few questions before you begin drawing: What does the detective&#8217;s office look like? Is it clean or filled with clutter? If the latter, what kind of clutter? How would you draw this scene if you wanted to make it dramatic and place the emphasis on the man with the gun? What if you wanted to make it comedic? How many ways can you arrange these three people and a small dog in this environment?</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<h2 id="Using-Photo-Reference"><a href="#Using-Photo-Reference" class="headerlink" title="Using Photo Reference"></a>Using Photo Reference</h2><p>If I were given a dollar every time I heard someone say, &#8220;Using photographs for reference is cheating,&#8221; I&#8217;d be a rich man. It&#8217;s a common misconception and one that I shared when I was younger. I thought that a real comic artist could draw anything from his or her imagination. However, although some artists don&#8217;t rely heavily on photographic reference, almost all of them have to use it at some point.</p>
<p>A photograph can help you capture any number of poses. Several artists I know who have to draw a page a day use themselves exclusively as their models; they&#8217;re both artist and muse. Photo reference for objects and environments also allows you to add specific details, which prevents your images from being too generic.</p>
<p>The only thing you want to avoid is being a slave to photographs, simply tracing a picture to create a drawing. Unless you&#8217;re a skilled photographer and know how to avoid the visual distortions created by different focal lengths, most of your photographs will be distorted to some extent, and if you simply draw on top of them, your drawings will look awkward and stiff.</p>
<p>However, if you use a photograph as a point of reference to help you visualize a difficult pose, it can be an extremely useful aid. Taking photographs today is easier than ever. Digital cameras can be purchased for under $20, and almost every smartphone has a camera built into it.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8afparqrj20tx0xsgoj.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8afparqrj20tx0xsgoj.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aqdv8faj21gt0icq5u.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aqdv8faj21gt0icq5u.jpg" alt=""> This panel was drawn by using those pictures on the previous page for reference. You can use a projector, light box, or software program to create a composition that incorporates your photo reference. However, remember that your photos are reference, and you can&#8217;t simply trace over them.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8abqrpdxj215x0dhgom.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8abqrpdxj215x0dhgom.jpg" alt=""> The final inked image is impressive. It is well composed, the car and buildings have specific details, and the black placement and inking make it very energetic. The photographs of the car and building allowed the artist to give the illustration specific, idiosyncratic details.</p>
<h2 id="Visual-Research"><a href="#Visual-Research" class="headerlink" title="Visual Research"></a>Visual Research</h2><p>Consider this scenario: You&#8217;ve just been assigned a story that takes place in New York City in the 1920s. The main character, David Duncan, has an office in the Flatiron Building, but he commutes daily via commuter train from his suburban house in White Plains, New York. Each day, Mr. Duncan stops at a newsstand in Grand Central Station to purchase three newspapers: the New York Herald Tribune, the New York Times, and the Evening World.</p>
<p>These newspapers will become significant later, after Mr. Duncan is framed for the murder of a prestigious stage actress. Each of these papers documents his arrest and the salacious allegations in front-page stories.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan is incarcerated on Blackwell&#8217;s Island (the majority of the story will take place here) before being exonerated.</p>
<p>To do this story justice (pun intended), you&#8217;ll need to do a lot of research. In addition to finding photos of all the buildings involved, you&#8217;ll need to find references for the various types of clothing worn in the 1920s by these character types: successful businessmen, street vendors, policemen, and so forth.</p>
<p>Since the newspapers play a prominent role in the story, you&#8217;ll need to find images of them from this era and deconstruct the way they were designed. How did the front page of each newspaper appear? What typeface did each paper use?</p>
<p>Since the majority of the story takes place in a penitentiary, you will have to learn about its history. Who was imprisoned there? What were the living conditions?</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>TRY IT</p>
<p>Here is a good and enjoyable way to create unique characters: take photographs of friends and exaggerate their features. Turn them into heroes, villains, monsters, and the like.</p>

<p>Before the Internet was ubiquitous, locating reference material could be a tedious and time-consuming process. Illustrators used to collect photographs from magazines, separate them by subject, and house them in drawers and filing cabinets. This type of reference collection had a specific name: morgue.</p>
<p>The good news is that researching is easier than ever. It&#8217;s just a click away. Everyone knows Google and Wikipedia, and generally, these two sites can either provide you with all the references you need, or suggest another specific website that contains the material for which you are looking.</p>

The blue lines would disappear as if by magic when they were photocopied. Erasers weren&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<h2 id="Inking-Tools"><a href="#Inking-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Inking Tools"></a>Inking Tools</h2><p>Although technology has made it possible to ink artwork digitally, the majority of comic book pages still are inked with a pen or a brush. These tools are remarkably versatile and, when mastered, can be used to create an astonishing variety of marks, effects, and textures.</p>
<p>This chapter will introduce you to the tools and techniques that I&#8217;ve used as a professional comic book inker. You will begin with some basic but crucial exercises to develop your skills and your understanding of how the nib and the brush behave. These lessons will become increasingly complex and enjoyable. But first, here are the tools you&#8217;ll need.</p>
<h3 id="PEN-NIBS"><a href="#PEN-NIBS" class="headerlink" title="PEN NIBS"></a>PEN NIBS</h3><p>Illustrators, calligraphers, and comic book artists use pen nibs almost exclusively. Although there used to be numerous manufacturers of pen nibs, the only American company still producing the crow quill variety of nibs is Speedball. The nibs are still referred to as Hunt nibs by most artists, after the C. Howard Hunt Pen Company, which created the nib. (The barrel of every nib still bears the original manufacturer&#8217;s imprimatur.)</p>
<p>Speedball sells an inexpensive sketching project set that contains six different pen nibs and two penholders. If you have never inked with a nib before, this is the best and most economical way to get started. The set allows you to experiment with a range of nibs that vary in size and flexibility.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a4ogk9zj211h0w5777.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a4ogk9zj211h0w5777.jpg" alt=""> Pen nibs and holders can be purchased separately, and as of this writing, Speedball sells an artist&#8217;s set that has six different nibs and two holders for under $10.</p>
<p>Two Japanese companies, Tachikawa and Deleter, also sell three excellent nibs: Maru, G, and Saji. These nibs are well constructed and have a very long life span. The Maru pen is similar to the Hunt; it has a very sharp point that is capable of making a very fine line and is flexible enough to produce a wide variety of marks and line widths. The G pen is larger but is capable of making lines as fine as those made with the Maru nib, and it is virtually indestructible. I&#8217;ve used the same G nib for over six months; most of my Hunt 102 nibs lasted only a week, at best, before they lost their flexibility and fine line. The Saji nibs have a spoon point, which means the tip is rounded; most nibs have a very sharp point. This spoon point makes it easy to make marks in any direction, but it tends to have a slightly thicker line. Several pen manufacturers make nibs with spoon points, and they all work perfectly with whiteout.</p>

<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a2r4k17j21491290vu.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a2r4k17j21491290vu.jpg" alt=""> Pen nibs have two types of barrels: cylindrical (Hunt 102 and Maru pens) and broad barreled (Hunt 108 and G pens). The holders are cheap (around $1), and the Japanese companies make a universal penholder for both types of nibs.</p>
<p>Try using different nibs to ink the same subject to get a feel for how each nib reacts and behaves. Firm nibs are great for clean line work, but it might be best to use a flexible nib to create a gritty surface texture. The only way to know what works for you is to experiment and practice using as many tools as possible.</p>
<p>A FEW OTHER NECESSARY ITEMS FOR INKING</p>
<p>&#8226; A container for water to keep your pen clean</p>
<p>&#8226; A cotton rag or coffee filter to wipe away excess ink</p>
<p>&#8226; A pad of legal paper or an old magazine to use as a surface onto which you can shake out excess ink from the pen</p>
<p>&#8226; A straightedge razor blade or X-Acto knife to scrape away any dried ink from the nib</p>
<h3 id="WHY-INK-WITH-A-PEN-NIB"><a href="#WHY-INK-WITH-A-PEN-NIB" class="headerlink" title="WHY INK WITH A PEN NIB?"></a>WHY INK WITH A PEN NIB?</h3><p>Here&#8217;s a question many beginning sequential artists ask when they are introduced to a crow quill pen (a drawing pen that must be dipped into a container of ink to &#8220;load&#8221; it): &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I use a Pigma Micron or some other mechanical pen?&#8221; It&#8217;s a valid question. Many comic artists use them. They contain acid-free, archival ink and, because they can be held like a pencil, are easy to use. They&#8217;re very convenient, are easy to carry, and are great for location sketching. I sometimes use them when inking pages&#8212;for certain things. These things include mechanical backgrounds and elements that require uniform line consistency. However, they are incapable of producing the varying line widths and the textured patterns and marks of a pen nib.</p>
<p>Reluctance to use a pen nib stems from being unacquainted with the tool. If you are unfamiliar with pen nibs, you may be confused about which one to use. After all, they come in an array of shapes and sizes, and the tips can be either firm or very flexible.</p>
<p>The best way to overcome your disinclination to use a nib is to avoid using any other tool to ink with for a while and make a habit of practicing every day with a nib. If you do this, your hand will adapt very quickly and you will feel comfortable using a nib in less than two weeks.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a42nfgpj21400u5n05.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a42nfgpj21400u5n05.jpg" alt=""> You can purchase pen nibs by the gross (144 nibs) at a significant discount. You can also find them occasionally on Craigslist and eBay at bargain prices.</p>
<p>ANATOMY OF A PEN NIB</p>
<p>Pen nibs vary in shape, size, and flexibility. Drawing nibs can be identified by their sharp tips. Although any nib can be put to use as a drawing tool in the hands of a skilled artist, most broad-tipped nibs are used for hand lettering and calligraphy.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajb0aolj20jf0uqq5y.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajb0aolj20jf0uqq5y.jpg" alt=""> A good brush, in the hands of a skilled artist, can produce lines as thin as those from a crow quill pen, and the only limit on its maximum width is the size of the brush itself. This highly detailed cover illustration was inked entirely with a brush.</p>
<h3 id="BRUSHES"><a href="#BRUSHES" class="headerlink" title="BRUSHES"></a>BRUSHES</h3><p>A good brush is an inker&#8217;s best friend. It holds much more ink than a pen nib; this means that unlike a nib, you can use it for long uninterrupted periods. It can be used on almost any paper; it glides over the paper&#8217;s surface and will not pick up tiny paper fibers the way a pen does. The brush is also capable of producing the greatest range of line widths.</p>
<h3 id="CHOOSING-BRUSHES"><a href="#CHOOSING-BRUSHES" class="headerlink" title="CHOOSING BRUSHES"></a>CHOOSING BRUSHES</h3><p>Although you can use any brush for some things, such as filling in large areas of black and creating special effects, your primary brush should be a genuine sable-hair watercolor brush. For the last fifteen years I&#8217;ve used either a Rapha&#235;l Series 8404 size 2 or 3 brush or a Winsor &amp; Newton Series 7 size 2 or 3 brush for all my professional inking jobs.</p>
<p>A quality sable-hair brush is a result of great design, materials, and craftsmanship. It has several significant advantages over other brushes, one of which is crucial for comic book artists: it always comes to a fine point. That feature is worth its weight in gold. A big brush, such as a size 4, is capable of producing a line as fine and thin as that of a size 00 brush. A good brush also has a longer life span than do cheaper brushes, so don&#8217;t be tempted by the lower prices. A novice inker should begin with a size 2 brush&#8212;a quality version Rapha&#235;l or Winsor &amp; Newton can be found online for under $20.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a64xpxuj20qe1majuc.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a64xpxuj20qe1majuc.jpg" alt=""> You need a high-quality sable-hair brush for inking. All brush companies manufacture a large assortment of brushes, and so a brush&#8217;s series number is very important. Pictured here from left to right are the Windsor &amp; Newton Series 7, the Escoda Series 1212, and the Rapha&#235;l Series 8404&#8212;my personal favorite.</p>
<h3 id="PURCHASING-BRUSHES"><a href="#PURCHASING-BRUSHES" class="headerlink" title="PURCHASING BRUSHES"></a>PURCHASING BRUSHES</h3><p>Although most high-quality sable-hair watercolor brushes come to a fine point, there are occasional duds. Purchasing brushes online almost always saves you money, but I order at least three when I buy them from a website. Most of the time all three brushes are excellent, and on the rare occasion when they aren&#8217;t, I have never received more than one defective brush in any single order. All the large and reputable stores have return policies that allow you to exchange defective items free of charge, and they pay for the return shipping.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of purchasing brushes from a retail store is that you can test them. Bring a bottle of water and your sketchbook (which you should always have with you, right?) to the store. Let a salesperson know you would like to test a few brushes. Most art stores keep them locked up or behind the counter to prevent them from being stolen&#8212;because of their size (small) and relative cost (higher than most other brushes). Dip the brush in your water until the bristles are saturated and then roll it on a piece of paper, rotating it as you pull it downward, until most of the excess water is gone. The brush should come to a fine point. Make a few test marks to confirm that it does not lose its point immediately. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know you have a good brush.</p>
<p>ART SUPPLIES WEBSITES</p>
<p>The following websites are reputable and keep an extensive array of art supplies in stock. All of them run sales regularly, so it&#8217;s a good idea to shop around before purchasing materials.</p>

<h3 id="MAINTAINING-AND-CLEANING-BRUSHES"><a href="#MAINTAINING-AND-CLEANING-BRUSHES" class="headerlink" title="MAINTAINING AND CLEANING BRUSHES"></a>MAINTAINING AND CLEANING BRUSHES</h3><p>A good brush can withstand thousands of working hours, if you clean and maintain it properly. Never, ever leave a brush sitting in a container of water. It will misshape the brush&#8217;s tip, and excess water can get caught between the wooden handle and the metal ferrule, causing the handle to become unstable or split.</p>
<p>Dip and swirl your brush in a container of water every twenty minutes and wipe it off on a cloth when you&#8217;re at the drawing table. This prevents ink from drying out near the ferrule of the brush, which makes it harder to clean later and can prevent the brush tip from coming to a fine point. When you have finished with the brush for the day, rinse it out with cold water.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a7vwlq8j219x0sf774.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a7vwlq8j219x0sf774.jpg" alt=""> Use brush soap or mild hand soap to thoroughly clean the bristles of your brush every two weeks. When you&#8217;ve finished cleaning it, make sure to rinse it with cold water and then use your fingers or mouth (you did just clean the brush!) to twirl the bristles back into a point. This helps the brush retain its shape.</p>
<h3 id="INK"><a href="#INK" class="headerlink" title="INK"></a>INK</h3><p>You&#8217;ll also need to purchase waterproof black ink (it is often labeled India ink) to use with your brush and pen nib. There are several types of ink on the market and just as many brands.</p>
<p>When choosing ink, consider its opacity and viscosity. What you choose depends on the tool you will be using. Opacity is easy to determine: if your ink is a uniform, deep black, then it is very opaque; if it contains different shades of gray when it dries, it isn&#8217;t. Viscosity is mostly determined when ink is used with a nib. If it doesn&#8217;t flow freely from the nib, the ink is too viscous. To thin it out, add a little water to your ink, or switch to using a brush for the thicker ink. When you use a pen, you need a free-flowing continuous line. If your ink is too thick, it will get clogged in the nib, disrupt your lines, and lead to frustration. A thicker ink is needed for the brush. A brush is often used to fill in large black areas, and thinner inks will dilute and create gray, washed-out areas.</p>
<p>Really almost any ink will suffice for a pen. If you buy a brand of ink that&#8217;s too thick, you can just add some distilled water to it and dilute it to your liking. Higgins standard drawing ink has the advantage of being sold at almost every local megastore (in the stationery or arts-and-crafts section), so it&#8217;s readily available to everyone. But while this ink works great with pens&#8212;it flows from the pen freely and makes a nice dark line&#8212;it tends to wash out and create areas of gray when used with a brush, particularly if you have to erase a penciled underdrawing.</p>
<p>You have to be more selective when buying ink for brushes. The ink needs to be both opaque and resistant to dulling when an eraser is used on it. Holbein has an excellent Special Black variety that flows freely and produces a lush, deep black. The only drawback is that you can only find it at specialty art stores or online, and it&#8217;s pricier than most. Higgins&#8217; Black Magic and Eternal ink varieties are thicker than drawing ink and work well with the brush.</p>
<p>Koh-I-Noor sells Universal Ink for its Rapidograph pens, and it works well with both nib and brush. I&#8217;ve heard other professionals say that something in the ink&#8217;s formula is more corrosive than other inks so it has a tendency to shorten the life of a brush, but I&#8217;ve never noticed this.</p>
<p>Many large online art stores are now producing art supplies and materials of their own. Like generic items in a grocery or retail store, they are usually cheaper and the difference in quality is minimal. The best way to find ink that works for you is to read online reviews and order a few small bottles (you can usually find them online for under $5) with which to experiment.</p>
<p>I use two containers of ink on my drawing table. One container holds pen ink, and the other ink for brushes.</p>
<p>TIP</p>
<p>For almost ten years, I used Pelikan ink religiously. It is amazing and affordable, works equally well with both my pen and my brush, and was sold in large 1,000-mL bottles. However, the formula seems to have changed in recent years, and it is almost impossible to find large bottles of the ink. However, the 1-ounce bottles can still be purchased easily.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ahgsgsej20zo177jum.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ahgsgsej20zo177jum.jpg" alt=""> Drawing inks, like brushes, are made by several different companies. Most local art supplies stores carry them in 1-ounce containers, but you can also buy them by the pint and the quart online.</p>
<h3 id="WHITEOUT-AS-A-DRAWING-TOOL"><a href="#WHITEOUT-AS-A-DRAWING-TOOL" class="headerlink" title="WHITEOUT AS A DRAWING TOOL"></a>WHITEOUT AS A DRAWING TOOL</h3><p>Most people think of whiteout as an inking eraser, something used solely to correct mistakes. However, whiteout can be used in many ways: to create patterns, to thin lines, to add designs into black areas, and to create halos around characters or objects.</p>
<p>I prefer Dr. Ph. Martin&#8217;s Bleed Proof White, an opaque, bright white watercolor. Its consistency when the bottle is first opened is fairly thick, but perfect for use with the brush. It usually takes only one stroke to cover an ink line. If you want to use it with a pen, you&#8217;ll need to add some water to it. Rather than adding water to the entire bottle, mix a small amount in a separate container. I keep two containers of white: one for use with a pen and one for with brush.</p>
<p>When using whiteout with a pen, lettering nibs with bowl points, such as the Hunt #512, are preferable. These nibs have a fine line but can be moved freely in any direction without tearing the paper.</p>
<p>TIP</p>
<p>If you leave the cap off of whiteout overnight (and trust me, everyone does this at some point), it will harden into a thick paste. Don&#8217;t throw it away. All you need to do is add some water to it incrementally and stir it with the handle of your brush or a chopstick until it returns to its original consistency.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aax8mjkj20s60lxwhi.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aax8mjkj20s60lxwhi.jpg" alt=""> Whiteout was used on the trees after this image was inked to increase the contrast between the trees and the house.</p>
<h3 id="PAPER-1"><a href="#PAPER-1" class="headerlink" title="PAPER"></a>PAPER</h3><p>Unlike pencil drawings, which you can make on any unlined paper available, inked pieces require high-quality paper because sharp pen nibs tend to tear into thin, inexpensive paper. Most American comic book artists use 11-inch by 17-inch sheets of Bristol board when they ink pages or covers.</p>
<p>Bristol board has two options for surface texture: plate and vellum. Plate paper has a very smooth glasslike surface and is ideal for both pen nib and brush. The vellum surface, also referred to as &#8220;kid&#8221; finish, is slightly &#8220;toothy&#8221; (it has a raised surface like a very fine sandpaper); this allows for some inking options that can&#8217;t be produced on a slick surface. For example, it is much easier to create a greater range of dry brush textures on vellum than on a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Several companies manufacture Bristol board that includes printed blue line guides with rectangular margins for the live, crop, and bleed areas. They also have vertical and horizontal rulers printed along the paper&#8217;s edges to ensure that panel borders are easy to place and that panel gutters are a uniform size.</p>
<p>In addition to the choice of surface textures, most companies make different &#8220;series&#8221; of their paper. The lower numbered series&#8217; papers are cheaper in both price and quality, but they are a good option for beginners to practice on. The 300-level series boards are durable enough for most professionals. The 500-level boards are superior in every way, (and include a &#8220;semismooth&#8221; option that has a very slight surface texture), but they cost almost three times as much as the 300-level boards.</p>
<p>However, there are other economical alternatives for novices looking to hone their skills. Any drawing or sketch paper that is more than 70 pounds will hold up to a pen nib. Borden &amp; Riley makes Bleedproof Paper for Pens, sold in pads with 40 sheets of paper, for about $10. Canson sells a mixed-media sketchpad with 60 sheets of paper for around the same price. I&#8217;ve also used 32-pound laser print paper to good effect for classroom presentations, and you can buy a ream (500 sheets) of this paper for approximately $15.</p>
<p>You should experiment and work with as many paper surfaces as possible: hot- and cold-pressed watercolor paper, vellum, illustration board, and so forth. Every paper has unique characteristics and will react to ink and tools differently. Gaining an understanding of these idiosyncrasies and the potential effects you can create by harnessing them will pay big dividends later.</p>

Some companies, such as Pro Boardz, will send you samples of their paper if you write to them and request it. (For more information, visit the company website at <a href="http://www.bcemylar.com/CAS/artboards.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.bcemylar.com/CAS/artboards.cfm</a>.)</p>

Both Canson and Borden &amp; Riley sell sketchbooks and pads of paper that can withstand a nib&#8217;s tip and cost only about $10 for 60 sheets of paper&#8212;perfect for practicing and improving your inking skills.</p>
<h2 id="Pen-Inking-Techniques"><a href="#Pen-Inking-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Pen Inking Techniques"></a>Pen Inking Techniques</h2><p>Observing, drawing, and inking objects from life will help you improve your skills quickly. Many young artists believe that if they aren&#8217;t drawing from their imagination, they&#8217;re &#8220;cheating.&#8221; Nothing could be further from the truth. Drawing and inking from life will help you understand how things are constructed and how light plays across different surfaces.</p>

A pen nib was used to create all the lines and textures on this comic page; a brush was used to fill in the large areas of black.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aqtmqjuj20j90ou77b.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aqtmqjuj20j90ou77b.jpg" alt=""> The values in this illustration were made exclusively with pen strokes.</p>
<h3 id="FUNDAMENTALS"><a href="#FUNDAMENTALS" class="headerlink" title="FUNDAMENTALS"></a>FUNDAMENTALS</h3><p>Remember, if you have never used pen nibs before, the best way to familiarize yourself with them is to play around.</p>
<p>Take out a piece of Bristol board and begin making marks. The beauty of using Bristol board is that it is thick enough that you can use the back for practice without worrying about it being seen from the front.</p>
<p>Try drawing straight lines and curved lines, moving the nib in different directions, and changing the pressure on the nib while making a line to see how it affects the line&#8217;s shape and width.</p>
<p>Each nib has individual characteristics. Some produce very fine lines but are very sharp, which means you have to rotate the penholder in your fingers if you change the direction of the line; some move freely in any direction but may not be as flexible or have the ability to make a very fine line; other pens are very flexible and can produce a wide variety of marks but may be difficult to control in areas where precision is needed. You can think of very flexible nibs as metal brushes, meaning their tips open up very quickly, creating a thicker line when you apply a slight amount of pressure. Firmer nibs require much more pressure to create a line that may be only slightly thicker than the original line.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ag3e3opj20m00wfad2.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ag3e3opj20m00wfad2.jpg" alt=""> The bold and gestural areas of black in this comic page were made with a brush. All the thin lines were made with a nib, and the artist chose not to use a ruler when inking the structural elements in the page.</p>
<p>A TYPICAL WORKSPACE FOR INKING</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am2rmoxj20rk10otbr.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am2rmoxj20rk10otbr.jpg" alt="">   INKING WITH A PEN NIB</p>
<p>This exercise is designed to help you explore a nib&#8217;s versatility and begin to train yourself to control lines. After creating a series of squares, you will begin to fill them in with a series of lines and marks. Each line should begin on one side of your square and end on the opposite side. Try not to allow the inked line to end before touching the square&#8217;s border and try not to extend the line past it.</p>
<p>Most important, do not rush your line. I have seen students who think the line will be straighter, cleaner, and more confident if they make a quick stroke. This is a mistake. It is better to take your time, even if the line wobbles or falters. Your lines, along with your confidence, will improve over time; trying to speed through this or any other exercise never helps.</p>
<p>&#8226; Draw thirty-five 1-inch squares on a sheet of Bristol board. Leave at least a half inch between squares.</p>
<p>&#8226; Scan the page after you have completed this; it will serve as a digital template for future exercises.</p>
<p>&#8226; Look at examples on the following page and try to replicate the lines and patterns.</p>
<p>&#8226; Create your own patterns after you have completed this exercise.</p>
<p>&#8226; Try using a variety of nibs for the exercise. Not only is it good practice, it will help you identify the nib or nibs that work best for you.</p>

<h3 id="CREATING-VALUE-WITH-LINE"><a href="#CREATING-VALUE-WITH-LINE" class="headerlink" title="CREATING VALUE WITH LINE"></a>CREATING VALUE WITH LINE</h3><p>Line defines a person or object&#8217;s shape, and value defines its form. Value, when used in the context of art, is defined as the relative lightness or darkness of a surface. Creating areas with value in a drawing that is primarily linear produces depth and prevents a drawing from looking flat. Note: tone and value are the same in this context.</p>
<p>Some media, such as charcoal and drawing pencils, are relatively easy to manipulate to create a broad range of values. Simply apply more pressure if you want a darker line, and use an eraser to lighten the value if you find that an area is too dark. Ink is solid black, so lines and marks have to be built up to create successful value transitions.</p>
<p>Creating a few value scales is the best way to practice and to understand how to create tonal transitions. There are two basic approaches to creating value scales: stepped and continuous.</p>
<p>For stepped value scales, the lightest value is at one end of the scale and the darkest value is at the other end.</p>
<p>A continuous value scale is created inside a long rectangle. The transition from dark to light is smooth and subtle. The examples on the opposite page were created within a series of 1-inch boxes and use different mark-making approaches to create a complete tonal range.</p>

Study the variety of marks used to create different surface textures: wood, stone, glass, etc. Note how the value range transitions from light (at the bottom of the drawing) to dark (at the top, and most dramatically, in the cast shadow), creating the illusion of light.</p>

For comics, a five-step value scale is sufficient. That is because a five-step scale creates the illusion of a full value range on the printed page.</p>

The pressure on the nib was increased as the artist went down the scale, and the marks were placed closer together as the artist moved from light to dark.</p>

<p>Create three to five of your own stepped and continuous value scales.</p>
<h3 id="CREATING-TEXTURES-AND-SURFACES"><a href="#CREATING-TEXTURES-AND-SURFACES" class="headerlink" title="CREATING TEXTURES AND SURFACES"></a>CREATING TEXTURES AND SURFACES</h3><p>After you&#8217;ve become comfortable with the pen and with the techniques covered earlier in this chapter, it&#8217;s time to start applying those skills and approaches to real-life subjects and compositions.</p>
<p>You can use tone to provide a realistic distribution of light and shadow; you can also use it to create interesting monochromatic compositional designs through the distribution of areas of black, white, and gray. Both of these approaches are beneficial, especially when you learn to ink.</p>
<p>Working from observation and trying to re-create the various textures and surfaces of different objects (wood, glass, metal, fur, etc.) will require you to examine your subjects thoroughly and experiment with mark-making and the ways in which you can combine those marks.</p>
<p>Drawing and inking objects from observation is instructive and a great way to get accustomed to using your pen in different ways. Although comic illustration for the most part doesn&#8217;t adhere to naturalistic styles (instead relying on design, pattern, and a good distribution of black, white, and gray). Drawing and inking everyday objects is always a good idea. You are more likely to experiment with your inking tools if you aren&#8217;t focusing on perfecting your comic book pages.</p>
<p>Everyone has a preconceived idea about how his or her comic illustrations should look, and this often inhibits experimentation, which prevents discovery. When you understand the full range of marks a nib is capable of making, and get accustomed to making those marks yourself, new discoveries will find their way into your comic book work.</p>
<p>TRY IT</p>
<p>Take an object, light it with a single light source, and spend no more than ten minutes making a good linear construction drawing in pencil. Complete the drawing with pen and ink. Make a few of these studies and use a different nib for each one. This will to teach you to draw with ink, and not just trace pencil lines.</p>

<h3 id="THE-RAISED-RULER-TECHNIQUE"><a href="#THE-RAISED-RULER-TECHNIQUE" class="headerlink" title="THE RAISED-RULER TECHNIQUE"></a>THE RAISED-RULER TECHNIQUE</h3><p>Long, straight lines are often used to construct inanimate objects such as buildings, props, and vehicles. Artists often use T-squares and rulers when pencilling them. Pen nibs can also be used with rulers and, once again, have several advantages over mechanical pens: you don&#8217;t need to switch tools to create lines with different widths, you can create line-width variations within a single line, and multiple lines can be inked without moving the ruler.</p>
<p>A metal ruler with a cork bottom is the best choice for inking with a nib. A nib can scratch and create divots in a plastic ruler, disrupting a neat line and rendering the ruler useless. A nib glides across a metal ruler, and the cork bottom creates a beveled edge even if you don&#8217;t lift the ruler off the paper&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>However, becoming comfortable with lifting a ruler off the surface of the paper is important. Once you have become proficient with this technique, it can be applied to other tools, such as French curves.</p>
<p>TRY IT</p>
<p>Take three to five objects that have different shapes and surfaces and arrange them in an interesting composition. Make a linear pencil drawing, scan it, print out three copies on Bristol board (either vellum or smooth), and ink it. Concentrate on how you can use mark making to distinguish the objects you&#8217;ve chosen and create an illustration that is visually appealing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin practicing the raised ruler technique by laying your ruler on a piece of Bristol board. Place your thumb on the bottom of the ruler; this will prevent it from moving when you ink a long line.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am7l61hj20w50iagnt.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8am7l61hj20w50iagnt.jpg" alt="">   2. Lift the ruler with your fingers until the bottom metal edge of the ruler rests comfortably on the paper. I usually rest my index finger at the top of the ruler, between the ruler and the paper, to stop it from slipping up or down. After dipping your nib in ink, rest the barrel of the nib on the ruler&#8217;s edge and pull a long straight line.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a8sd9ytj20w50iaac0.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a8sd9ytj20w50iaac0.jpg" alt="">   3. After you are comfortable with this technique, try creating lines of different but consistent widths by changing the pressure on the pen, as in the above examples.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ahr6okuj20w60bc415.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ahr6okuj20w60bc415.jpg" alt="">   4. Now create a series of long lines, varying the pressure of the pen as you&#8217;re drawing the line. Create lines that begin thin and get consistently thicker and lines that begin thick and get consistently thinner, by varying the pressure as you make the lines, allowing them to bounce and skip.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a4ekvnhj20w60qmdj2.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a4ekvnhj20w60qmdj2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="USING-A-NIB-WITH-A-FRENCH-CURVE"><a href="#USING-A-NIB-WITH-A-FRENCH-CURVE" class="headerlink" title="USING A NIB WITH A FRENCH CURVE"></a>USING A NIB WITH A FRENCH CURVE</h3><p>Once you are comfortable using a nib with a straight rule, you are ready to use it with a French curve. Most French curves are beveled, their outer edges are raised off the paper&#8217;s surface, preventing ink from bleeding under when you ink with a nib. However, most curves are made out of plastic, so you must lift the French curve high enough to touch the nib&#8217;s barrel. If you don&#8217;t, you can easily chip a good curve and will have to replace it.</p>
<p>TIP</p>
<p>Beveled French curves are often labeled as having an &#8220;inking edge.&#8221; An inking edge is the same as a beveled edge. Metal curves are more expensive, but they don&#8217;t chip and will last a lifetime. However, they don&#8217;t have a beveled edge. What to do? Get some superglue or tape and attach pennies to the bottom of the curve. You&#8217;ve just created a beveled edge!</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aea5lj4j21eo0ufn06.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aea5lj4j21eo0ufn06.jpg" alt=""> The lifting technique you use with a French curve is identical to that used with a ruler. After finding the right curve for the line you intend to ink, place your thumb on the bottom of the curve and lift the opposite side with your index finger. If you feel more comfortable leaving the curve on your drawing surface, make sure to shake out the excess ink from your nib before you begin inking the line.</p>
<h2 id="Brush-Inking-Techniques"><a href="#Brush-Inking-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Brush Inking Techniques"></a>Brush Inking Techniques</h2><p>The brush is probably the most versatile inking tool available. It holds a lot of ink (so you don&#8217;t have to dip it in an inkwell constantly), it can produce lines that range from razor thin to incredibly thick, and because it doesn&#8217;t gouge the paper&#8217;s surface, it dries very quickly.</p>
<h3 id="HOLDING-THE-BRUSH"><a href="#HOLDING-THE-BRUSH" class="headerlink" title="HOLDING THE BRUSH"></a>HOLDING THE BRUSH</h3><p>For fine detail work or when you are working in small areas, hold the brush the same way as any other drawing tool&#8212;with your fingers positioned close to the brush&#8217;s ferrule. This provides more control, but limits the mark-making range. However, when you want to make long sweeping lines, hold the brush perpendicular to the paper. The stroke will emanate from the arm, not the fingers and wrist. This takes some practice, but the sooner you begin, the sooner you will become comfortable with it. Mastering this technique augments your set of skills and provides unique inking possibilities.</p>
<p>Before you begin, clear everything from your drawing table except ink, water, and a piece of paper. You don&#8217;t want anything to interrupt your brushstroke, as one of the biggest advantages of this technique is that you can make very long lines. Place your elbow on the table first (it will serve as a fulcrum, and it can&#8217;t do that if it isn&#8217;t resting on a solid surface). Lower your hand over the paper without touching it and make a few &#8220;ghost&#8221; strokes in the air over the paper, using your elbow as a pivot point. Position the paper to correspond to the natural sweep of your stroke. After doing that, lower your hand until your palm touches the paper and then lower the brush until it just touches the paper. Now lock your hand and fingers in place&#8212;they shouldn&#8217;t move after you establish how thick you want the line to be&#8212;and begin pulling a straight line using your arm. Your hand should never move up or down.</p>
<p>This always feels awkward when you first try it, and people&#8217;s hand positions vary, but the one thing you have to keep in mind here is that the brush must be held straight up and down, perpendicular to the paper. I extend my pinkie finger for additional stability, but there isn&#8217;t a single right way. If you have never inked this way before, don&#8217;t worry about anything other than maintaining a consistent line width. Make thin lines, thick lines, and lines of any other widths in between. The brush is truly remarkable and capable of more line variation than any other inking tool.</p>
<p>Learning how to hold and control a brush is vital and isn&#8217;t very hard. If you practice daily, you can master it quickly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rest your elbow on the drawing table, hold the brush perpendicular to the paper (this will seem awkward when you first try it, but it&#8217;s critical), and lower your arm, allowing the palm of your hand to make contact with the paper first.</li>
</ol>

Lower your fingers until the brush just touches the paper. The fingers not holding the brush will be used to support your hand and prevent it from moving up or down, providing a consistent line.</p>

Play around with the brush. Here I&#8217;m holding the brush at a 45-degree angle while pressing down a lot. This creates a very thick line that has straight, square edges.</p>

<p>When you have become comfortable with the brush, it&#8217;s time to do some structured exercises. This exercise is identical to the pen exercise, as is its goal: learning to control the brush while discovering its unique characteristics and possibilities.</p>
<p>&#8226; Print out the series of 1-inch squares you created and scanned for the pen exercise on this page.</p>
<p>&#8226; Bristol board is preferable but not necessary; a brush can be used on almost any type of paper.</p>
<p>&#8226; Look at these examples, try to re-create them, and remember, especially when using a brush, to make straight lines and to try to begin the line at one side of the square and end it when it touches the opposite side. Confident inking is the result of learning to control your tools. If you can make a consistent straight line with a brush, you can create that same line with any other tool you pick up.</p>

The brush is also capable of creating an enormous variety of marks that a nib can&#8217;t. A sable-hair watercolor brush is capable of making more marks than any other inking tool. Load it up with ink and draw thick lines by pressing down on it, wipe most of the ink from the brush and create textures using dry brush techniques, and stipple with the brush, etc. Play with the brush on paper, and see how many different textures and marks you can make.</p>
<p>In the following examples, the artist uses a brush to interpret her composition in three unique ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concentrating on the relative values within the composition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ink at least two of the objects that you initially drew for the pen studies with a brush (remember to always scan your pencil drawings).</p>
<p>Select new objects to draw and ink. Ask yourself what surfaces and textures lend themselves to the fluid lines and remarkable range of line widths that are unique to the brush. Play and experiment.</p>

It is often used by (but not limited to) &#8220;mainstream&#8221; comic artists and inkers to create a slick, professional look.</p>
<p>You should be able to quickly add this skill to your inking arsenal, as long as you have a good brush.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dip the brush into the inkwell and bring it to a nice point by twirling it on a spare pad of paper. A good sable-hair brush will assume an inverted teardrop shape with a razor-sharp point.</li>

<h3 id="DRY-BRUSH"><a href="#DRY-BRUSH" class="headerlink" title="DRY BRUSH"></a>DRY BRUSH</h3><p>If a slick and smooth approach doesn&#8217;t suit your style or if you want to create some interesting areas of contrast within your inked drawings, you may want to consider using the dry brush technique. This technique isn&#8217;t difficult, but if you choose to use it extensively to create a full range of values, it requires patience and takes a while to master.</p>
<p>Dry brush techniques work best on vellum surfaces. The paper&#8217;s &#8220;teeth&#8221; create hills and valleys, which cause the brush to skip along its surface. You should also experiment with cold-pressed watercolor paper; its surface is even toothier, which creates distinct lines and patterns.</p>
<p>This technique can be hard on your brushes, and so it&#8217;s best not to use a new sable-hair brush for this approach. Use a cheap synthetic brush or an old sable-hair brush (never throw old brushes away) instead.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove most of the ink from the brush. It&#8217;s best to use a vellum surface for this; it removes the ink quickly, and the uneven surface spreads the brush&#8217;s hairs apart.</li>

Both the pen and the brush have unique characteristics, and discerning artists utilize a combination of both to best depict their subject matter. Combining both tools increases the range of possibilities significantly.</p>
<p>Pens and brushes are a comic book artist&#8217;s primary inking tools, but anything that can make a mark can be used. After all, as long as it leaves an impression on the paper, you can darken it in Photoshop or any of several other software programs to create solid black marks or textures.</p>
<p>Lithographic crayons, children&#8217;s crayons, and soft graphite pencils can be used to create gritty surfaces. You can apply ink to many kinds of fabric, lace, and other materials and press them against your paper. Cotton balls, Q-tips, and sponges create distinct tones and textures.</p>
<p>You can also rub textures onto lightweight printer paper with a lithographic pencil, as long as the surface you&#8217;re working with is firm enough to withstand the pressure. These marks can be scanned, adjusted, and easily applied to your illustrations with a software program. Once they&#8217;re scanned, be sure to save and organize them so you can reuse them in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Masking-an-Illustration"><a href="#Masking-an-Illustration" class="headerlink" title="Masking an Illustration"></a>Masking an Illustration</h2><p>You can mask off simple shapes with bits of paper, and in a pinch you can use an X-Acto knife, printer paper, and a light box to create more complicated shapes. However, frisket film, a low-tack sheet of clear vinyl, is the best choice for masking off intricate areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8akbnpepj20rz0mjdiu.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8akbnpepj20rz0mjdiu.jpg" alt=""> It is always a good idea to mask areas off you don&#8217;t want to be affected when you&#8217;re working with materials that aren&#8217;t easy to control&#8212;sponges, fabrics, sheets of plastic, and so forth.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a772iggj20ge0m6go8.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a772iggj20ge0m6go8.jpg" alt=""> Frisket is a thin translucent plastic film backed with a low-tack adhesive. It adheres to the paper but can be removed or repositioned easily, and it won&#8217;t harm the paper or remove ink.</p>

You can see through the sheet of frisket. Use an X-Acto knife or razor blade to cut out frisket matching the space you need to cover. Remove the film from the back of the frisket, apply it to the paper, and cut away any excess.</p>

When that dried, I took a razor blade and cut out organic areas of white.</p>
<h2 id="X-Acto-Knives-and-Straight-Razors"><a href="#X-Acto-Knives-and-Straight-Razors" class="headerlink" title="X-Acto Knives and Straight Razors"></a>X-Acto Knives and Straight Razors</h2><p>You can use X-Acto knives to cut into paper and create a thin, organic white line within a black area (think concertina wire atop a prison&#8217;s walls). Straight razors will also do the trick, and I prefer them because they are more durable and their points are less likely to break. A razor is ideal for reflective surfaces or when you need to create a picture that includes something exploding.</p>
<p>Note: You should always wear some sort of eye protection when working with a razor blade. Although it&#8217;s rare, the tips can snap and fly into the air.</p>

<h2 id="Sponges-Toothbrushes-and-Other-Alternative-Inking-Tools"><a href="#Sponges-Toothbrushes-and-Other-Alternative-Inking-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Sponges, Toothbrushes, and Other Alternative Inking Tools"></a>Sponges, Toothbrushes, and Other Alternative Inking Tools</h2><p>You can use anything that can be dipped in ink to make marks: sponges, toothbrushes, Q-tips, sticks, fingers, crumpled paper towels, and so on. Sponges are particularly useful and come in all shapes and sizes. You can cut or tear an old household sponge (or a new one if you&#8217;re a spendthrift) into a few different shapes and sizes, and you can purchase an assortment of sea sponges in the pottery section at most art supplies stores. The marks a sponge makes depend on the sponge&#8217;s consistency and the amount of ink you use with it. Generally, you&#8217;ll want to remove most of the ink by dabbing the spouge on a scrap piece of paper before applying it to your piece.</p>
<p>You can also use items from the kitchen. What types of marks does a Brillo pad make? How about a dishrag? Crumple up some paper towels, napkins, and newspaper and dip them in ink. Experiment with varying levels of ink and see how many unique marks you can create.</p>
<p>Dentists recommend that you replace your toothbrush every three months to ensure proper dental hygiene. Don&#8217;t throw them away! You can use them to create interesting splatter patterns. Just dip an old soft-bristled toothbrush in ink and tap it on a scrap piece of paper so that you won&#8217;t drop a big blob of ink on your page. When the excess ink has been removed, hold the toothbrush above the page and flick the bristles with your thumb. If you don&#8217;t have gloves handy, use a butter knife or a ruler on the brush&#8217;s bristles. If you want to create a smaller, more controlled splatter effect, try using a pen nib and a credit card. Just hold the card firmly in one hand and the pen nib in the other and flick the nib against the card.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t mind getting your hands dirty, dip your fingertips in the ink, dab most of the ink off, and then use your fingertips on the page. It creates a unique texture that can be used for smoke effects, or to create a &#8220;gritty&#8221; surface.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling really adventurous, pick up a stick or cooking skewer and try to ink a drawing with it. I&#8217;ve seen a video of Alberto Breccia, an amazing comic artist from Argentina, creating a beautiful ink drawing with a straightedge razor blade.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8alee795j20w30whgom.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8alee795j20w30whgom.jpg" alt=""> Apply a small amount of ink to an old toothbrush. If you have a bottle of ink with an applicator, you can use it to drop a small amount of ink onto the brush, or you can dip the brush in an inkwell and tamp most of it out on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aazluuyj20w40kqmz5.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aazluuyj20w40kqmz5.jpg" alt=""> Hold the brush in your hand and flip the bristles with your thumb. You can also drag it across an old credit card (or something similar) if you don&#8217;t want to get your hands dirty. Try this a few times on a scrap piece of paper until you can control the range of the ink splatter.</p>
<p>TIP</p>
<p>Q-tips can be used to cover large black areas quickly and extend the life span of a good brush. You can also use old brushes for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ammkls2j20jb0s5tbt.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ammkls2j20jb0s5tbt.jpg" alt=""> The smoke in this illustration was created by using the splatter technique and applying whiteout with the fingers.</p>
<h2 id="Black-and-White-Design"><a href="#Black-and-White-Design" class="headerlink" title="Black-and-White Design"></a>Black-and-White Design</h2><p>Learning how to design in black and white and with tones improves your ability to see and create compositions that have a good tonal range. A well-designed black-and-white image will always look good, with color or without.</p>
<h3 id="SCREENTONES"><a href="#SCREENTONES" class="headerlink" title="SCREENTONES"></a>SCREENTONES</h3><p>A screentone (often referred to as Zip-A-Tone) is a thin sheet of plastic film covered with halftone dot patterns or textures. The back of the film is coated with a low-tack adhesive such as frisket. The dot patterns vary in density and size, and there are hundreds of different patterns and textures on the market.</p>
<p>Screentones work particularly well with black-and-white comics and newspaper strips but rarely are employed in comics that use computer coloring; (as are most of the comics being published in the United States today. Screentone might have become obsolete if it weren&#8217;t for manga comics). Most Japanese comics are still published in black and white and use screentones exclusively.</p>
<p>Black-and-white comics often rely on textures and patterns to enhance their visual appeal, but creating them by hand is a time-consuming process. Time is a commodity most working comic artists don&#8217;t have&#8212;particularly manga artists, who often have to produce ten to twenty pages a week. Screentones cover large areas with patterns or textures quickly and enhance the artwork. The line work used by the artist can be more &#8220;open&#8221; and less detailed; this approach can save a lot of time.</p>
<p>The largest contemporary manufacturer of screentones is a Japanese company named Deleter. Thanks to the Internet, its products are easy to access and purchase. The only drawback is that at $5 to $7 per sheet, they&#8217;re a little pricey.</p>
<p>A library of digital tones can be purchased for the price of a few sheets of screentone. It never needs to be replaced, it&#8217;s tones can be applied with the computer, and a large tone collection is often included with some excellent computer software programs such as Manga Studio (more on this in chapter 8). If, however, you think of your pages as artifacts and plan to sell your original artwork, nothing beats the real thing.</p>

This particular grid method is one of the quickest and most effective ways to create intricate establishing shots.</p>
<p>Begin by using the same steps you used to create your first grid: create a new document, display the rulers, drag the horizon line down from the top ruler, and then select the Polygon tool and check to make sure all its properties are correct. You don&#8217;t need to change the color of the lines for this grid; you&#8217;ll discard them later.</p>
<p>Create two vanishing points on the horizon with the Polygon tool. You need to use the Polygon tool only once on each side, but try to make at least one perfect square when you drag the lines out from the second vanishing point.</p>

<h2 id="Using-the-Perspective-Tool-in-Manga-Studio"><a href="#Using-the-Perspective-Tool-in-Manga-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Using the Perspective Tool in Manga Studio"></a>Using the Perspective Tool in Manga Studio</h2><p>The professional version of the art program Manga Studio (EX) includes several special perspective rulers that the regular version (Debut) does not. These rulers are well worth the slightly higher price tag. You can create small freehand perspective drawings, scan them, import them, and then complete your drawing. The rulers allow you to create a horizon line and use one, two, or three vanishing points. After you establish the height of the horizon line and create vanishing points along it, any line you draw will either be straight or recede to your vanishing points.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a freehand sketch using a grid you&#8217;ve created. Scan it in as a 300-dpi 8-bit greyscale PNG or JPEG image and save it to your desktop.</li>

A new properties window will open up. Two tabs are located in the top right of this window: Position Adjust and Image Adjust. Position Adjust allows you to change the scale or adjust the position of your drawing (you can also adjust the scale of the image by dragging the red anchors around the image). The Image Adjust tab has two tabs of its own: Layer Settings and Filter Settings. Filter Settings allows you to change the image&#8217;s contrast or resolution.</p>

Layer Settings allows you to rename your drawing. However, the most important step at this point is to make sure that the Color Model tab is set to Gray (8 bits). Occasionally, the program will import your file as a 2-bit grayscale file, and it will appear incomplete. When you reset it to 8 bits, the resolution clears up immediately. Click OK.</p>

Move the vanishing points into place by clicking on them while holding down the shift key (you must hold shift to prevent the horizon line from moving while you adjust these points). They will turn from purple to red when they are selected. Make sure to click the background, returning the color of your point to purple, before moving to the other vanishing point. You can move the perspective lines that emanate from the vanishing points in the same way: click on them to move them and click the background to deselect them when you have them in the desired position.</p>

Lock the perspective layer by clicking the Lock Layer icon in the Ruler Layer window. This will prevent you from moving it accidentally. If want to change the position of the vanishing points later to draw an object that is in a different position but still has its vanishing points along the same horizon line (remember chapter 3 on perspective?), just unlock the layer, select the object mover tool, hold down the shift key, and reposition the vanishing points. Then lock the layer again.</p>

<h2 id="Using-Manga-Studio-to-Apply-Screentone-Patterns"><a href="#Using-Manga-Studio-to-Apply-Screentone-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Using Manga Studio to Apply Screentone Patterns"></a>Using Manga Studio to Apply Screentone Patterns</h2><p>The art program Manga Studio has hundreds of screentone patterns in its toolbox, and it&#8217;s very easy to place and manipulate them. It&#8217;s also fun. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Manga Studio, it&#8217;s best to begin by using the Beginner&#8217;s Assistant window. This function arranges all of the program&#8217;s basic tools, pallets, and options on the right-hand side of the computer screen.</p>
<p>Note: for the purposes of this book, I have used Manga Studio version 4 for all examples.</p>
<p>TIP</p>
<p>Make sure that the screentones you choose don&#8217;t create a moire pattern (an unintentional optical distortion) when the page you are working on is reduced and printed. The easiest way to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen is to reduce the page to the size it will be in your published comic and print it out. If it appears distorted, adjust the screentone and try again.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a8mp10lj211p0rzwhc.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a8mp10lj211p0rzwhc.jpg" alt=""> This image was sketched by hand, scanned, and inked digitally with Manga Studio. It&#8217;s a nice clean drawing, but let&#8217;s give it some patterns and texture.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Manga Studio and select the Beginner&#8217;s Assistant: Window &gt; Beginner&#8217;s Assistant. Import your inked page. (Refer to this page for details.)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajjvqjnj214y0tg77j.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8ajjvqjnj214y0tg77j.jpg" alt="">   2. Use the Lasso tool to select an area where you&#8217;d like tone to be applied. If you are working with artwork that doesn&#8217;t have any gaps in the inked lines (this is called a trapped area), you can use the Magic Wand tool.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a44xbr3j218e0kwtbp.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a44xbr3j218e0kwtbp.jpg" alt="">   3. Navigate to the right of the computer screen and click the Tone tab. Several screentone options will appear in the window when you select this tab. You can view them all or select them by category by clicking the pattern types. Spend a few minutes looking through them and select one you wish to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8afcdlzwj20mt112gok.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8afcdlzwj20mt112gok.jpg" alt="">   4. Click and drag your screentone over to the canvas. The tone will drop into the selected area. A new layer will be created automatically when you place a tone on your drawing. Thus, if you use three tones in an illustration, each will have its own layer.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8anbu01dj20ii0xbtbk.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8anbu01dj20ii0xbtbk.jpg" alt="">   5. If you use Beginner&#8217;s Assistant, a Properties window will appear when you place a new tone. (If you don&#8217;t see this window, you can make it appear by selecting Window &gt; Properties.) The Properties window allows you to modify the scale, the line density, the brightness and contrast, and the angle of the shapes used to create the tone.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a7mqc6vj21hi0eo0vu.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a7mqc6vj21hi0eo0vu.jpg" alt="">  <img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aiwswm7j20vo0nhjug.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8aiwswm7j20vo0nhjug.jpg" alt=""> Screentones can produce animation-style line art visually interesting and make color unnecessary.</p>
<p>TIP</p>
<p>Since Manga Studio creates a new layer for every screentone you use, you can use other tools (Pen, Pencil, Brush, etc.) to apply that screentone anywhere you want on that layer.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a5ivooxj20sq0vbtbn.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/6a9fdecaly1fs8a5ivooxj20sq0vbtbn.jpg" alt=""> My son, Koji (age ten), drew this character recently, and I drew my version of it for him. I inked it by using both brush and pen nib and then added digital tones.</p>
<h1 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h1><p>Drawing comics is fun, but it&#8217;s also a lot of work. Figure drawing, being able to construct objects and environments from your imagination, and having a true understanding of perspective all take time. You have to dedicate hours and hours to active learning.</p>
<p>In my experience, the key to success is setting small goals and pursuing them relentlessly. When you master one goal, name a new one and get started. If you take this approach, the day will come&#8212;sooner than you think&#8212;when you have more abilities in your possession than you have left to master. When you master all the necessary skills, creating comic art feels much more like play than work.</p>
<p>Make drawing a daily practice. You will become better, and faster if you devote an hour a day, every day, to drawing. The better you get, the more fun drawing becomes. You&#8217;ll find that the hours fly by while you create worlds that only exist in your imagination.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
