Where am I going?&#8221; Reinvention is in our genes. But often it&#8217;s been repressed by institutions that want us standardized. Clones of each other so we can be easily replaced. But&#8230; Life is changing. The economy is changing. We are getting unstuck in our lives. The greatest opportunity we ever had to change and have the lives we want is happening right now. Every time you reinvent, you need to figure out the variables for a simple equation: PLUS: Who are the people you can learn from? Real mentors, virtual mentors. EQUAL: Who are the people who can challenge us? We can&#8217;t get better unless we are constantly challenged and then get feedback from our mentors. MINUS: Who are the people we can teach and share with and make an impact on? Without this, one can never truly become a master.
